    "question_text": "a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that 'respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.' Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources ('bill of rights') of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?", 
    "answer_text": "a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon.\n\nb) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so.\n\nc) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states."

    "question_text": "Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.", 
    "answer_text": "This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly.\n\nAccording to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'.\n\nIn order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- WÃ¼rttemberg).\n\nIn particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law.\n\nIn addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office).\n\nHowever, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium).\n\nIn addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency."

    "question_text": "Throughout the course you have been trained in reading and analysing the case law of the European Court of Justice. Below is a judgment of the European Court of Justice, C-561/19, Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA Your assignment: 1. Present the decision of the case (7 p.). This presentation should include, in your own words: a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding '[5]' where appropriate.", 
    "answer_text": "a) A summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about:\n\nThe Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not.\n\nb) What procedures occurred in what courts and why:\n\nThe national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU.\n\nc) Description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice:\n\nWhether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing.\n\nd) Description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law:\n\nArticle 267 TFEU\nPrinciples of effectiveness and equivalence\n\ne) How the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed:\n\nCJEU:\n- The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27]\n- The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32]\n- There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33]\n- Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46].\n- The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53]\n- It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56].\n- Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59].\n- National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63].\n- There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70].\n\nf) Came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s):\n\nThe fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness.\n\n2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding \"[5]\" where appropriate.\n\nThe Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU).\n\n- Court of last instance have an obligation to refer.\n- The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27]\n- The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33]\n- The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44].\n- A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51]\n- Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54]\n- The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]"
