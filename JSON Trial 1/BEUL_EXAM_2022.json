    "question_text": "Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The preliminary ruling procedure d) Indirect effect e) Subsidiarity", 
    "answer_text": "a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process.\n\nb) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered.\n\nc) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights.\n\nd) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem.\n\ne) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that \"[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence\", \"The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level\". The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard."

    "question_text": "Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B. Juan is Spanish and lives in Madrid with his Argentine wife Carmen. The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not? (Reason as with A(i) above), yet use question B facts.) ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation? (Include whether it can bring a court proceeding against Portugal.) Your assignment: Answer each sub-question from a EU law perspective. Support your answers by referring at every opportunity during your answers when relevant references are made of sources of EU law. Make clear which sub-question you are answering. Where appropriate provide specific examples (like in math class), not simply an unexplained answer. In other words describe several steps applying the law you have learned to these facts and demonstrating your understanding of how they fit within the broader context of the EU legal system functions.", 
    "answer_text": "A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy\n\ni) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a \"worker\" from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here.\n\nAn Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a \"duty of loyalty\" to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible.\n\nAny Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this \"public service exception\" must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case.\n\nii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have \"procedural autonomy\", in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law.\n\nThere will be \"direct effect\" for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is \"effective\" (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least \"equivalent\" to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.)\n\nB. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal\n\ni) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her.\n\nInterference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference.\n\nJustification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal.\n\nii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the \"watchdog of the Union\") could seek a Union-level remedy. It has \"standing\" to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a \"direct action\" against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a \"reasoned opinion\") to the Member State, giving it the \"opportunity to submit its observations\" and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices."
