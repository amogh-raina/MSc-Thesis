Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"a) **Indirect challenge of an EU act**: This concept refers to the situation where the validity of an EU act is challenged before a national court, not directly but incidentally, in a dispute that has been brought before it. In such cases, the national court may, and sometimes must, refer the question of validity to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling.

b) **National procedural autonomy**: This principle acknowledges that in the absence of specific EU rules, it is for the domestic legal system of each Member State to designate the courts and tribunals having jurisdiction and to lay down the detailed procedural rules governing actions for safeguarding rights which individuals derive from EU law. However, these national procedures must not be less favorable than those governing similar domestic actions (principle of equivalence) nor render virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by EU law (principle of effectiveness).

c) **The principle of supremacy**: This fundamental principle of EU law states that European Union law has primacy over national laws of EU Member States. This means that in areas where the EU has competence, laws adopted at EU level take precedence over national laws. This principle ensures the uniform application of EU law across all Member States.

d) **Non-legislative EU act**: These are acts adopted by EU institutions that are not part of the legislative process outlined in the Treaties. They can include delegated acts, implementing acts, or other acts such as decisions, opinions, or recommendations issued by the European Commission, Council, or other EU bodies. As highlighted in ""Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union,"" these acts can involve both the creation of implementing rules and the application of rules to specific cases.

e) **Field of application of EU fundamental rights**: The field of application of EU fundamental rights refers to the scope within which these rights, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, apply. This includes situations where Member States are implementing Union law, as well as situations where EU institutions are acting. Fundamental rights are applicable in all areas where the EU has competence, ensuring that the actions of the EU and its Member States respect these rights.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","In the given scenario, Big Fun, the Danish company selling the 'Bang' toy gun in Sweden, may have grounds to rely on the Safe Toys Directive, despite Sweden's failure to implement it. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, meaning it regulates all issues related to the production, marketing, and sale of toys in the Member States comprehensively. Its purpose is to reduce disparities in rules between Member States that hinder toy trade and impede the proper functioning of the internal market.

One of the key goals of the directive is to limit situations where a toy can be banned. Specifically, the directive allows the prohibition of a toy's production, marketing, or sale only when it is ""obviously dangerous in normal use."" This provision aims to create a uniform standard across the EU for when toys can be banned, superseding more restrictive national standards like Sweden's prohibition on toys imitating firearms.

The case of ""The Queen, on the application of: Swedish Match AB and Swedish Match UK Ltd v Secretary of State for Health"" supports the idea that EU measures can require Member States to authorize the marketing of products under certain conditions or even prohibit the marketing of products. This principle can be applied to the Safe Toys Directive, suggesting that Sweden's ban on toys imitating firearms might be overridden by the directive's criteria for banning toys.

Moreover, the principle established in ""Criminal proceedings against Gunnar Nilsson, Per Olov Hagelgren and Solweig Arrborn"" clarifies that national rules applying without distinction as to the origin of the products do not fall within the scope of Article 30 (now Article 34 TFEU) on the free movement of goods. However, Sweden's ban specifically targets a type of toy that is being marketed by a company from another Member State, which could be seen as a measure having equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction on trade between Member States.

Given these considerations, Big Fun can argue that the Swedish ban on toys imitating firearms is incompatible with the Safe Toys Directive. The directive's provisions on when a toy can be banned should prevail over the Swedish legislation, as the directive aims to harmonize and facilitate trade within the internal market. Therefore, Big Fun may rely on the directive to contest the legality of the Swedish ban and the lawsuit brought by Happy Times.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","a) **Special legislative procedure**: This term refers to the various legislative processes in the EU that do not follow the ordinary legislative procedure, which typically involves the European Parliament and the Council of the EU acting together. The special legislative procedures are determined by the legal basis of the measure, as emphasized in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union,"" where it is established that the legal basis of a measure dictates the procedure to be followed in adopting that measure. This means that depending on the Treaty article under which a measure is proposed, different procedural rules may apply, sometimes involving other institutions or requiring unanimity rather than qualified majority voting.

b) **Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs)**: MEQRs are rules enacted by EU Member States that are capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade. This concept is clarified in ""Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany,"" which references the seminal case ""Dassonville."" This interpretation is consistently supported by other cases such as ""Commission v Denmark"" and ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands."" These measures, although not outright quantitative restrictions like quotas, can still impede trade and are thus covered by the prohibition set out in Article 28 EC (now Article 34 TFEU).

c) **Concerted practices**: The term ""concerted practices"" is not explicitly defined in the provided context. However, in EU competition law, concerted practices generally refer to forms of coordination between undertakings which, without having reached the stage where an agreement properly so-called has been concluded, knowingly substitute practical cooperation between them for the risks of competition. This concept is often discussed in cases related to anti-competitive behavior under Article 101 TFEU.

d) **Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings**: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are processes initiated by the European Commission against Member States that fail to fulfill their obligations under EU law. These proceedings can lead to judgments by the Court of Justice of the European Union, as seen in cases like ""Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany"" and ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands."" These actions ensure that Member States comply with their Treaty obligations and EU legislation.

e) **Proportionality**: The principle of proportionality requires that measures adopted by Member States do not exceed what is necessary to achieve their objectives. In the context of MEQRs, national legislation that hinders trade can be justified on grounds of public interest or imperative requirements, but only if the measure is appropriate for securing the objective and does not go beyond what is necessary. This principle is highlighted in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands,"" which references cases like ""Commission v Italy"" and ""Commission v Finland."" The proportionality test ensures that any restrictions on trade are balanced against the legitimate aims of the national legislation.","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law.","a) The Belgian authorities' stance that Cynthia can no longer be considered an ""EU worker"" due to her reduced working hours is not in accordance with EU law. In ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium,"" it was established that restrictions on workers based on nationality are prohibited under Article 7 of the Treaty. Additionally, EU law emphasizes the right of residence for workers who can produce a valid identity card or passport, irrespective of their entry document, as clarified in ""Mouvement contre le racisme, l'antisémitisme et la xénophobie ASBL (MRAX) v Belgian State."" Therefore, Cynthia's change in employment status should not affect her right to reside in Belgium as an EU national.

b) The rejection of Cynthia's application for a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media solely based on her not being a Belgian citizen is in accordance with EU law. As outlined in ""Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon,"" Member States have the right to restrict admission of foreign nationals to certain positions in the public service that require a special relationship of allegiance to the State. This principle allows for such restrictions to ensure the bond of nationality, as also seen in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium.""

c) The rejection of Cynthia's application for a job at a private academy based on her nationality and linguistic requirements is a more nuanced issue. While EU law prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality, as seen in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium,"" the requirement for linguistic competence can be justified if it is a genuine and determining occupational requirement. In ""Government of the French Community and Walloon Government v Flemish Government,"" it was clarified that citizenship of the Union does not extend to internal situations without a link to Community law. If the linguistic requirements are genuinely necessary for the job due to the diverse linguistic needs of exchange students, this could be a legitimate reason for the rejection, provided it is applied equally to all applicants regardless of nationality.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","In resolving the EU law-related issues in the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough, the key question is whether the 1948 Law on Public Safety, specifically Paragraph 138, can be enforced given the provisions of the Safe Building Directive adopted by the EU in 2015. The directive aims to harmonize building standards across Member States to facilitate trade in construction work within the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive detail good building practices for various types of buildings, and critically, Article 20 prohibits Member States from introducing any further requirements beyond those specified in Articles 5-15.

Good Enough argues that Paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety should be set aside because it conflicts with Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive. The directive was implemented in Fantasia through the 2016 Construction Act, which mirrors Articles 5-15 of the directive. However, the 1948 Law on Public Safety was not amended or repealed.

The principle of the primacy of EU law is crucial here. EU law takes precedence over conflicting national laws. In ""Commission v Belgium,"" the Court held that a Member State failed to fulfill its obligations because it did not provide workers with the protection envisaged by a directive in all relevant cases. This underscores the importance of compliance with EU directives.

Moreover, the principle of legal certainty is relevant. As established in ""Belgische Staat v Cobelfret NV,"" the Court restricts the opportunity to rely on an interpreted provision to challenge legal relationships established in good faith only exceptionally. This exception applies when those concerned acted in good faith and there is a risk of serious difficulties.

In this context, Good Enough's reliance on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive is justified. The directive explicitly prohibits Member States from imposing additional requirements beyond those specified in Articles 5-15. Since shelters are not mentioned in these articles, Fantasia's 1948 Law on Public Safety, which mandates shelters, conflicts with the directive.

Big Money's argument that the 1948 Law on Public Safety concerns a separate issue of public safety does not override the directive's provisions. The directive's aim to harmonize building standards encompasses all aspects of construction, including safety features. The fact that the 1948 Law was not repealed does not negate the primacy of EU law.

Therefore, as a judge, I would rule that Paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in this case. Good Enough can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive, which takes precedence over the conflicting national legislation. This conclusion is supported by the principles of the primacy of EU law and legal certainty, ensuring that EU harmonization goals are upheld.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","a) **The Ordinary Legislative Procedure (OLP)** is the main legislative procedure used in the EU decision-making process. It involves the joint adoption of a proposal by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, with each institution acting as a co-legislator. The procedure typically includes three readings, during which the Parliament and the Council can propose amendments to the legislation. This process ensures that both institutions have an equal say in the adoption of EU laws, reflecting the democratic principles enshrined in the Treaties.

b) **State Liability** refers to the principle that Member States can be held liable for damages caused to individuals by their breach of EU law. This principle was established in the joined cases of ""Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others."" The Court outlined a system of rules regarding Article 215 of the Treaty, which considers the complexity of situations, difficulties in applying or interpreting texts, and the margin of discretion available to the author of the act in question. This ensures that individuals can seek compensation for damages resulting from a Member State's failure to comply with EU law.

c) **The Preliminary Ruling Procedure** is a mechanism that allows national courts to refer questions of EU law to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for interpretation. This procedure ensures the uniform application and interpretation of EU law across all Member States. When a national court has doubts about the interpretation or validity of EU law, it can request a preliminary ruling from the CJEU. This collaborative process between national courts and the CJEU helps maintain the consistency and effectiveness of EU law.

d) **Indirect Effect** refers to the obligation of national courts to interpret national law in conformity with EU law, even if the national legislation predates the EU legislation. This principle ensures that EU law is effectively applied within the legal systems of Member States. The concept of indirect effect is crucial for the harmonization of national laws with EU law, promoting the uniform application of EU legal principles across the Union.

e) **Subsidiarity** is a principle that governs the exercise of powers by the EU institutions. It requires that, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the EU shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central level or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level. This principle ensures that decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen and respects the powers of the Member States, promoting efficient and effective governance within the EU.","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,
"Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B. Juan is Spanish and lives in Madrid with his Argentine wife Carmen. The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not? (Reason as with A(i) above), yet use question B facts.) ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation? (Include whether it can bring a court proceeding against Portugal.) Your assignment: Answer each sub-question from a EU law perspective. Support your answers by referring at every opportunity during your answers when relevant references are made of sources of EU law. Make clear which sub-question you are answering. Where appropriate provide specific examples (like in math class), not simply an unexplained answer. In other words describe several steps applying the law you have learned to these facts and demonstrating your understanding of how they fit within the broader context of the EU legal system functions.","**A(i)**: The Italian public school's decision to deny Anna employment based on her not being an Italian citizen is not in conformity with EU law. The principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality is a fundamental aspect of EU law. In ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic,"" it was established that any measure that draws a distinction based on residence is likely to disadvantage nationals of other Member States, as non-residents are typically foreigners. This principle is further supported by the ruling in ""Ciola,"" which clarifies that a measure does not need to disadvantage only nationals of other Member States to be considered discriminatory.

Moreover, the decision directly negates the freedom to provide services, as it makes it impossible for persons established in other Member States to provide services in Italy, as seen in ""Commission v Belgium."" Therefore, the school's decision interferes with Anna's right to free movement as an EU citizen. To justify such an obstacle, the public interest relied on must not already be safeguarded by the rules to which the service provider is subject in their home Member State, as established in ""Commission v Spain."" In this case, there is no evident public interest that would justify the school's decision.

**A(ii)**: Anna can bring court proceedings against the decision. According to the principle established in ""Commission of the European Communities v Portuguese Republic,"" the situation must be determined by reference to the situation prevailing at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion, suggesting that Anna can challenge the decision based on the current circumstances. She can bring proceedings in the Italian courts under the authority of EU law principles, including the right to non-discrimination and the right to free movement. Additionally, the European Commission could initiate infringement proceedings against Italy if it considers that Italy has failed to fulfill its obligations under EU law.

**B(i)**: The Portuguese authority's decision to deny Carmen a residence permit is not in conformity with EU law. In ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Spain,"" it was established that the right of entry into the territory of a Member State granted to a third-country national who is the spouse of a national of a Member State derives from the family relationship alone. Therefore, the issue of a residence permit to a third-country national who is the spouse of a Member State national is to be regarded not as a measure giving rise to rights but as a measure serving to prove the individual position of a national of a third country with regard to provisions of Community law. Thus, Carmen's right to reside in Portugal is derived from her marriage to Juan, a Spanish (and therefore EU) citizen.

**B(ii)**: If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits to individuals like Carmen, the European Commission can take action at the EU level to remedy the situation. The Commission can initiate infringement proceedings against Portugal for failing to fulfill its obligations under EU law. This process involves sending a letter of formal notice to Portugal, followed by a reasoned opinion if the issue is not resolved. If Portugal still does not comply, the Commission can refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union. This process is supported by the principles established in cases such as ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"" and ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities,"" which emphasize the importance of compliance with EU obligations and the role of the Court in enforcing these obligations.","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","1) Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) states that Member States have a duty to fulfill their EU obligations. This principle of sincere cooperation requires Member States to take all appropriate measures to ensure fulfillment of their obligations under EU law, including those arising from directives such as Directive (EU) 2016/2284.

2) The European Union can take formal action towards Italy if it suspects that the country is breaching Union law. The European Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, can initiate infringement proceedings against Italy for failing to report the monitoring data as required by Article 10.4 of the Directive. This process typically involves several steps. First, the Commission sends a letter of formal notice to Italy, requesting it to comply with its obligations within a specified period. If Italy does not comply, the Commission may then send a reasoned opinion, detailing the alleged infringement and setting a deadline for Italy to take the necessary measures. If Italy still does not comply, the Commission can refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) under Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This process is well-established and has been used in various cases, such as ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic,"" where the Commission initiated proceedings against Italy for non-compliance with environmental directives.

3) If the CJEU finds that Italy has failed to fulfill an obligation under the Treaties and Italy does not comply with the judgment, the Commission can bring the case back to the CJEU under Article 260 TFEU. In this second round of proceedings, the CJEU can impose financial penalties on Italy for its continued non-compliance. These penalties can include a lump sum and/or a daily fine until Italy complies with the judgment. This mechanism ensures that Member States are held accountable for their obligations under EU law and provides a strong incentive for compliance. The principles established in cases like ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"" underscore the importance of Member States taking necessary measures to protect human health and the environment, and the CJEU's role in enforcing these obligations.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,

When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","**1. Presentation of the decision in 'Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix':**

a) **Summary of the relevant facts:**
   The case involved the Commission of the European Communities and Frédéric Daffix. The dispute centered around a decision made by the Commission that adversely affected Daffix. The core of the dispute was whether the Commission had provided a proper statement of reasons for its decision, which is a requirement under EU law.

b) **Procedures:**
   The case was brought before the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Court was tasked with reviewing the legality of the Commission's decision, particularly focusing on the adequacy of the reasons provided.

c) **Central legal issue(s):**
   The central legal issue discussed by the Court of Justice was whether the decision adversely affecting Daffix included a sufficient statement of reasons. This requirement is intended to ensure that the affected person can understand the basis of the decision and that the Court can review its legality.

d) **Relevant legal rules:**
   The legal principle at stake is derived from case law, notably from cases such as ""Michel v Parliament,"" ""Lux v Court of Auditors,"" and ""Pérez-Mínguez Casariego v Commission."" These cases establish that a decision adversely affecting a person must provide a statement of reasons that is detailed enough to allow the person to assess the decision's foundation and enable the Court to review its legality [12].

e) **Arguments and analysis:**
   The Court, referencing established case law, emphasized that the requirement for a proper statement of reasons is essential for ensuring that decisions are well-founded and can be legally reviewed. The Court analyzed whether the Commission's decision met this standard by examining the details provided and their sufficiency in allowing Daffix to understand the reasons behind the decision [12].

f) **Conclusion:**
   The Court concluded by assessing whether the Commission's decision provided a clear and sufficient statement of reasons. The analysis was based on the principles established in the referenced case law, ensuring that Daffix had enough information to understand the decision and that the Court could review its legality.

**2. Importance of the case in the general scheme of EU law:**

The case 'Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix' is significant in the context of EU administrative law, particularly concerning the requirement for administrative decisions to be well-reasoned. This requirement is a cornerstone of the principle of transparency and legal certainty in EU law. The case reinforces the importance of providing a proper statement of reasons in decisions that adversely affect individuals, ensuring that such decisions can be scrutinized and understood by the affected parties and the courts.

Reflecting on what we have studied, this case aligns with the broader principles of EU law that emphasize transparency, accountability, and the right to effective judicial protection. It underscores the necessity for EU institutions to act in a manner that is not only legally sound but also clearly communicated to those affected by their decisions. This transparency is crucial for maintaining trust in EU institutions and ensuring that individuals can effectively challenge decisions that impact them.

The case also highlights the procedural requirements under the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, as seen in cases like ""Commission v Ireland"" and ""Commission v Finland,"" where the Court emphasizes the need for applications to be clear and precise. This ensures that defendants can adequately prepare their defense and that the Court can rule effectively without exceeding the scope of the application (ultra petita) or failing to address a complaint.

Overall, 'Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix' contributes to the body of EU law by reinforcing the importance of clear and sufficient reasoning in administrative decisions, thereby promoting transparency and legal certainty.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","a) An absolute right is one that cannot be balanced against other interests or rights and must be upheld strictly. In contrast, a relative right can be balanced against other interests or rights, and limitations may be imposed on it, provided these limitations are proportionate and necessary to achieve a legitimate objective. From the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, an example of an absolute right is the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, outlined in Article 4, which states that ""no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."" An example of a relative right is the freedom of expression, found in Article 11, which can be limited in certain circumstances, such as to protect national security or public safety.

b) In ""Internationale Handelsgesellschaft,"" the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) declared that respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the Court. This shift in the Court's approach can be attributed to several reasons. Firstly, the Court recognized the importance of fundamental rights in safeguarding the values and principles that underpin the European Union. By ensuring the protection of these rights within the framework of the Community, the Court aimed to maintain the legitimacy and integrity of EU law. Secondly, the Court sought to align EU law with the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, drawing inspiration from these traditions to ensure consistency and coherence in the application of fundamental rights. This approach is further supported by cases such as ""Nold,"" where the Court emphasized that fundamental rights form an integral part of the general principles of law and that measures incompatible with these rights are unacceptable in the Community.

c) The three principal sources of EU fundamental rights are the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. These sources are stated in the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The TEU, in Article 6(3), recognizes the rights, freedoms, and principles set out in the Charter. Additionally, the TEU acknowledges the importance of the ECHR and the constitutional traditions of the Member States in shaping the EU's fundamental rights framework. This recognition is further emphasized in the case law, such as in ""ERT,"" ""Connolly v Commission,"" and ""Schmidberger,"" where the Court consistently draws inspiration from these sources to ensure the observance of fundamental rights within the EU legal order.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","A) The decision by the Italian authorities to refuse Maria's residence renewal may not be in conformity with EU law. Under Article 39 EC, which guarantees freedom of movement for workers within the EU, any discrimination based on nationality regarding employment, remuneration, and other conditions of work is prohibited, as established in 'Angonese'. Furthermore, 'De Groot' clarifies that Member States cannot obstruct their nationals from accepting and pursuing employment in another Member State.

In 'Lawrie-Blum' and 'Collins', the Court ruled that any person who performs real and genuine activities, excluding those that are marginal and ancillary, is entitled to freedom of movement as a worker. Therefore, if Maria's part-time work is considered real and genuine, rather than purely marginal and ancillary, she should still be entitled to freedom of movement as a worker. The Italian authorities' decision to refuse her residence renewal based on her part-time status may violate these principles.

B) If Maria does not qualify as a 'EU worker', she may still have other options to reside in Italy. In 'Orfanopoulos and Others' and 'Oliveri', the Court established that migrant workers' right of residence is subject to the condition that they remain a worker or, where relevant, a person seeking employment, unless they derive that right from other provisions of Community law. This suggests that if Maria is actively seeking full-time employment or has other grounds for residence under EU law, she may still be able to reside in Italy. Additionally, if she has been continuously residing in Italy for a certain period, she might have acquired the right of permanent residence under Directive 2004/38/EC, which grants such rights to EU citizens who have legally resided in another Member State for five years.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,

Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA

#### Summary of the Relevant Facts
The case involves Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA, who brought a dispute against Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA. The specific details of the dispute are not provided in the context, but it involves questions related to the interpretation of Community law, which necessitated a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice.

#### Procedures Occurred in Courts
The dispute was initially brought before a national court in Italy. The national court, recognizing the need for a preliminary ruling to interpret Community law, referred the case to the Court of Justice under Article 234 EC. This procedure is consistent with the principle that national courts determine the need for a preliminary ruling and the relevance of the questions submitted, as seen in cases like ""Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA"" and ""Grundig Italiana SpA v Ministero delle Finanze.""

#### Central Legal Issue(s) Discussed by the Court of Justice
The central legal issue in this case revolves around the interpretation of Community law. The Court of Justice was called upon to provide a ruling that would help the national court deliver its judgment. This is in line with the Court's obligation to give a ruling when questions submitted by national courts concern the interpretation of Community law, as emphasized in ""Teresa Cicala v Regione Siciliana.""

#### Relevant Legal Rules (Provisions of EU Law)
The relevant legal rule in this context is Article 234 EC, which governs the cooperation between the Court of Justice and national courts. This article stipulates that national courts must determine the need for a preliminary ruling and the relevance of the questions submitted, and the Court of Justice is bound to provide a ruling when the questions concern the interpretation of Community law.

#### How the Parties Argued and the Court of Justice Analyzed
The parties likely argued over the correct interpretation of the relevant provisions of Community law. The Court of Justice, in accordance with ""Ministero dell'Industria, del Commercio e dell'Artigianato v Lucchini SpA,"" emphasized the separation of functions between national courts and the Court of Justice. The national court is responsible for assessing the facts and determining the need for a preliminary ruling, while the Court of Justice provides the legal interpretation.

#### Conclusion Regarding the Issue(s)
The Court of Justice concluded that it was obligated to provide a ruling on the interpretation of Community law, as the questions submitted by the national court fell within its jurisdiction. This conclusion is supported by the principle that the Court of Justice is bound to give a ruling when the questions concern the interpretation of Community law, as seen in ""Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA"" and ""Teresa Cicala v Regione Siciliana.""

### Importance of the Case in the General Scheme of EU Law

#### Legal Analysis
The case ""Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA"" underscores the critical role of the preliminary ruling procedure in EU law. This procedure ensures the uniform interpretation and application of Community law across all Member States. The Court of Justice's role in providing legal interpretations is essential for maintaining consistency and clarity in the application of EU law.

The case reaffirms the principle that national courts have the discretion to determine the need for a preliminary ruling and the relevance of the questions submitted. This discretion is crucial for the effective functioning of the judicial system, as it allows national courts to seek guidance from the Court of Justice when necessary. The Court of Justice, in turn, is obligated to provide a ruling, ensuring that Community law is interpreted consistently.

Moreover, the case highlights the importance of the statement of reasons required by Article 253 EC, as seen in ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities."" This requirement ensures transparency and accountability, enabling both the persons concerned and the competent courts to understand the reasoning behind the measures adopted.

In the broader context of EU law, this case reinforces the cooperative relationship between national courts and the Court of Justice. This cooperation is vital for the effective implementation of EU law, as it ensures that national courts have the necessary legal interpretations to apply Community law correctly. The case also emphasizes the Court of Justice's role in reviewing the legal classification of facts and the legal inferences drawn from them, as seen in ""European Parliament v Carlo Ripa di Meana, Leoluca Orlando and Gastone Parigi.""

In conclusion, ""Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA"" is a significant case that reaffirms the principles of cooperation between national courts and the Court of Justice, the importance of preliminary rulings, and the necessity of clear and transparent statements of reasons. These principles are fundamental to the effective and consistent application of EU law across all Member States.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"### a) Indirect Challenge of an EU Act

An indirect challenge of an EU act refers to a legal process where the validity of an EU act is questioned not directly before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), but rather in the context of a dispute between individuals or between an individual and a Member State. In such cases, national courts may refer questions to the CJEU regarding the validity of the EU act as part of their preliminary ruling procedure. This mechanism allows for the CJEU to assess the legality of EU acts in a manner that ensures their proper application within the Member States.

### b) National Procedural Autonomy

National procedural autonomy is the principle that allows Member States to determine their own procedural rules for the implementation of EU law. However, this autonomy is not absolute; it is subject to the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. Equivalence requires that the national procedures must be no less favorable than those governing similar domestic actions. Effectiveness ensures that the national procedures do not make it practically impossible or excessively difficult to exercise the rights conferred by EU law. This principle balances the need for uniform application of EU law with the respect for national legal systems.

### c) The Principle of Supremacy

The principle of supremacy, also known as the principle of primacy, establishes that EU law takes precedence over national law in cases of conflict. This means that if a national law contradicts EU law, the EU law must be applied. The principle of supremacy ensures the uniform application of EU law across all Member States and prevents Member States from undermining the effectiveness of EU law through their national legislation. This principle is fundamental to the functioning of the EU legal order and has been consistently upheld by the CJEU.

### d) Non-Legislative EU Act

A non-legislative EU act is a type of legal instrument adopted by the EU institutions that does not have the same legislative force as regulations, directives, or decisions. Non-legislative acts include delegated acts and implementing acts. Delegated acts are adopted by the European Commission to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. Implementing acts are adopted to ensure uniform conditions for implementing legally binding EU acts. These acts are subject to different levels of scrutiny and control by the European Parliament and the Council, depending on their nature and the specific provisions of the legislative act they implement.

### e) Field of Application of EU Fundamental Rights

The field of application of EU fundamental rights encompasses the areas in which these rights are protected and enforced within the EU legal order. EU fundamental rights apply to actions by EU institutions, bodies, offices, and agencies, as well as to the Member States when they are implementing EU law. This means that Member States must respect EU fundamental rights when they are acting within the scope of EU law, even if the specific right in question is not explicitly mentioned in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The CJEU has played a crucial role in defining and expanding the field of application of EU fundamental rights, ensuring that they are effectively protected across the EU.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","In the dispute between Happy Times and Big Fun, the key issue is whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive to defend against the claims made by Happy Times. The Safe Toys Directive is a maximum harmonization act that aims to regulate all aspects related to the production, marketing, and sale of toys within the Member States. The directive seeks to limit the situations in which a toy may be banned, allowing prohibition only when a toy is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. This directive was issued to address the significant differences in rules between Member States that have hindered trade in toys, thereby impeding the proper functioning of the internal market.

However, Sweden has not implemented the Safe Toys Directive, despite the implementation period having long since passed. This non-implementation is crucial because, under EU law, directives only become binding on Member States once they have been transposed into national law. Therefore, the directive cannot be directly relied upon by individuals or companies in national courts unless the Member State has properly implemented it. This principle is supported by the case law, such as in 'Criminal proceedings against Harry Franzén', where the Court emphasized the importance of national measures that align with EU directives.

Moreover, the Swedish legislation clearly prohibits 'immoral or inappropriate toys', including those that imitate firearms. This prohibition has been upheld by Swedish courts for over 30 years, indicating a consistent application of national law. Given that the Safe Toys Directive has not been implemented in Sweden, the national courts are bound to apply the existing Swedish legislation. This means that the Swedish courts will likely uphold the ban on toys imitating firearms, as they have done in the past.

Additionally, the case 'The Queen, on the application of: Swedish Match AB and Swedish Match UK Ltd v Secretary of State for Health' highlights that Member States may take appropriate measures, including provisional or definitive prohibitions on products, depending on the circumstances. This suggests that even if the Safe Toys Directive were implemented, there might be room for national measures to address specific concerns, such as the prohibition of toys imitating firearms.

In 'Criminal proceedings against Gunnar Nilsson, Per Olov Hagelgren and Solweig Arrborn', the Court held that an obligation on all traders to have their products distributed by a method authorized under national rules, which do not discriminate based on the origin of the products, does not fall within the scope of Article 30 of the Treaty. This implies that national rules that do not discriminate against imports can be justified, further supporting the application of Swedish law in this case.

In conclusion, Big Fun cannot rely on the Safe Toys Directive to defend against Happy Times' claims because the directive has not been implemented in Sweden. The Swedish courts are bound to apply the existing national legislation, which prohibits toys imitating firearms. Therefore, Big Fun's argument based on the Safe Toys Directive is unlikely to succeed in the Swedish courts.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","a) **Special legislative procedure**: This refers to the specific legislative procedures outlined in the Treaties that are followed when adopting certain types of EU legislation. The legal basis of a measure determines the procedure to be followed in adopting that measure. For instance, if a measure pursues multiple objectives or has several inseparable components, it may need to be founded on various corresponding legal bases, as seen in cases like 'Commission v Council'. Additionally, the legal basis of a measure dictates the procedures to be followed, as emphasized in cases such as 'European Parliament v Council of the European Union'.

b) **Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs)**: These are national rules or measures that, while not quantitative restrictions in the traditional sense, have the same effect by hindering intra-Community trade. The prohibition of MEQRs is set out in Article 28 EC and Article 30 of the Treaty. According to established case law, such measures include any legislation that can hinder, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade. This principle is well-established in cases like 'Dassonville', 'Commission v Germany', and 'Commission v Austria'. National legislation that constitutes a MEQR can be justified on grounds of public interest or imperative requirements, provided that the measure is appropriate and does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective, as seen in cases like 'Commission v Italy' and 'Commission v Finland'.

c) **Concerted practices**: This term refers to a form of anti-competitive behavior where undertakings knowingly substitute practical cooperation for the risks of competition. Concerted practices involve a form of coordination between undertakings that falls short of an agreement but that reveals a concerted action on the market. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of EU competition law, specifically under Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). While the provided context does not directly address concerted practices, this definition is based on established EU competition law principles.

d) **Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings**: These are legal actions taken by the European Commission against Member States for failing to comply with EU law. The Commission can initiate infringement proceedings if it believes a Member State has not fulfilled its obligations under the Treaties. The process typically involves a letter of formal notice, a reasoned opinion, and, if necessary, referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The context provided does not explicitly discuss enforcement actions, but this description is based on general principles of EU law enforcement.

e) **Proportionality**: This principle requires that any measure taken by EU institutions or Member States must be suitable for achieving the intended objective, must not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective, and must represent a fair balance between the public interest and the interests of the individual. The proportionality principle is a fundamental aspect of EU law, ensuring that measures are appropriate and do not impose an excessive burden. This principle is applied in various contexts, including the justification of MEQRs, as seen in cases like 'Radiosistemi' and 'ATRAL'.","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law.","### a) Cynthia's Residence Permit Renewal

Cynthia's situation regarding her residence permit renewal involves the interpretation of EU law on the rights of EU workers. According to the case ""Mouvement contre le racisme, l'antisémitisme et la xénophobie ASBL (MRAX) v Belgian State,"" a Member State cannot refuse to issue a residence permit to a third-country national who is married to a national of a Member State and entered the territory lawfully, solely on the grounds that their visa has expired. However, this case does not directly address the situation of an EU national like Cynthia.

The relevant legal principles come from the case ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium,"" which highlights that discrimination on grounds of nationality is prohibited under Article 7 of the Treaty. This principle suggests that Cynthia's employment status should not be the sole basis for denying her residence permit renewal, especially if she initially entered Belgium lawfully and has maintained a lawful presence.

Moreover, the case ""Raymond Vander Elst v Office des Migrations Internationales"" indicates that the application of national rules should not exclude substantial risks of exploitation or distort competition between undertakings. While this case focuses on temporary workers, it underscores the importance of fair treatment and non-discrimination, which could extend to Cynthia's situation.

Therefore, the Belgian authorities' decision to deny Cynthia's residence permit renewal based solely on her reduced working hours may not be in accordance with EU law, as it could constitute discrimination on grounds of nationality and fail to consider her initial lawful entry and continued residence.

### b) Cynthia's Job Application at the Ministry of Higher Education

The rejection of Cynthia's application for a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen raises issues of discrimination based on nationality. The case ""Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon"" clarifies that Member States can restrict admission of foreign nationals to certain positions in the public service, particularly those that require a special relationship of allegiance to the State. However, this restriction does not apply once a worker is admitted into the public service, as they should enjoy the provisions of Article 39(1) to (3) EC.

The case ""Commission v Belgium"" further supports this by stating that such restrictions are not provided for Belgian students, indicating a potential discrimination issue. Therefore, the Belgian law that only allows Belgian citizens to hold these jobs may not be in accordance with EU law, as it discriminates against EU nationals like Cynthia who are otherwise qualified for the position.

### c) Cynthia's Job Application at a Private Academy

The rejection of Cynthia's application at a private academy due to linguistic requirements and her non-Belgian citizenship involves complex issues of discrimination and the application of national rules. The case ""Commission of the European Communities v Grand Duchy of Luxembourg"" highlights that while Member States can apply their legislation to temporarily employed workers, this must not exclude the same protection or essentially comparable protection that the workers enjoy in their home Member State.

The case ""Government of the French Community and Walloon Government v Flemish Government"" clarifies that EU citizenship does not extend the material scope of the Treaty to internal situations without a link to Community law. However, the linguistic requirements and the rejection based on non-Belgian citizenship could be seen as indirect discrimination, as they disproportionately affect EU nationals like Cynthia.

Therefore, the private academy's decision to reject Cynthia's application based on linguistic requirements and her non-Belgian citizenship may not be in accordance with EU law, as it could constitute indirect discrimination and fail to provide the same protection that she would enjoy in her home Member State.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","In resolving the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough, the court must carefully consider the interplay between national legislation and EU directives, particularly the Safe Building Directive. The key issue revolves around the validity and applicability of paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety in light of the Safe Building Directive.

Firstly, the Safe Building Directive aims to harmonize building standards across Member States to facilitate trade in construction work within the internal market. Article 20 of the directive explicitly states that Member States may not introduce further requirements on construction work and good building practices beyond what is laid down in Articles 5-15. Since Articles 5-15 do not mention shelters as part of any building type, it is clear that the directive does not mandate the inclusion of shelters in buildings.

Given that the Safe Building Directive was adopted and entered into force before the contract between Big Money and Good Enough was signed, it is crucial to determine whether the 1948 Law on Public Safety, which mandates the inclusion of shelters, is compatible with the directive. The 1948 Law on Public Safety remains in effect, but its provisions must be examined in the context of EU law.

The court must consider the principle of legal certainty, which is inherent in the EU legal order. According to settled case-law, the court may restrict the opportunity for individuals to rely on a provision that has been interpreted, especially if there is a risk of serious difficulties. However, this principle applies exceptionally and requires that those concerned acted in good faith. In this case, Good Enough has relied on the Safe Building Directive, which was implemented by Fantasia, and has not acted in bad faith by assuming that the directive precludes additional national requirements not covered by the directive.

The court should also consider the principle that national laws must be interpreted in conformity with EU directives. In the case of 'Commission v Belgium', the court held that a Member State had failed to fulfill its obligations because it did not provide workers with the protection envisaged by a directive in all relevant cases. This principle suggests that national laws that conflict with EU directives should be set aside or interpreted in a manner that aligns with the directive.

In the context of the preparation of decisions on the clearance of accounts, the court has established that the reasons for a decision must be considered adequate if the Member State was closely involved in the decision-making process and was aware of the reasons for the Commission's decision. This principle underscores the importance of transparency and involvement in the decision-making process, which is relevant here as Fantasia was aware of the Safe Building Directive and its implications.

Given these considerations, the court should conclude that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in this case. The directive's aim to harmonize building standards and prevent additional national requirements not covered by the directive means that the 1948 Law on Public Safety cannot impose the shelter requirement. Therefore, Good Enough's argument that the shelter is unnecessary and that the directive precludes the additional requirement is valid. The court should rule in favor of Good Enough, as the contract stipulated compliance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019, but the directive precludes the additional requirement imposed by the 1948 Law on Public Safety.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","### a) The Ordinary Legislative Procedure (OLP)

The Ordinary Legislative Procedure (OLP), formerly known as the co-decision procedure, is the primary legislative process in the European Union. It involves the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union working together to adopt legislative acts. The legal basis of a measure determines the procedure to be followed in adopting that measure, as established in the case law, including the judgments in ""Parliament v Council"" (C-130/10) and ""Parliament v Council"" (C-658/11). This procedure ensures that both institutions have a significant role in the legislative process, promoting democratic legitimacy and accountability.

### b) State Liability

State liability in EU law refers to the principle that Member States can be held liable for damages caused by breaches of EU law. The system of rules governing state liability, particularly for legislative measures, takes into account various factors such as the complexity of the situations to be regulated, difficulties in application or interpretation of texts, and the margin of discretion available to the author of the act. This principle is elaborated in the case of ""Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others.""

### c) The Preliminary Ruling Procedure

The preliminary ruling procedure allows national courts to refer questions of EU law to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for interpretation. This procedure ensures the uniform application of EU law across Member States. It is particularly relevant under the EC Treaty, where the jurisdiction of the Court is more extensive compared to Title VI of the Treaty on European Union. The case of ""Gestoras Pro Amnistía, Juan Mari Olano Olano and Julen Zelarain Errasti v Council of the European Union"" highlights the limited jurisdiction under Title VI, emphasizing the importance of the preliminary ruling procedure in ensuring legal remedies.

### d) Indirect Effect

The principle of indirect effect, also known as the duty of consistent interpretation, requires national courts to interpret national law in a manner consistent with EU law, even in the absence of direct effect. This principle aims to ensure the full effectiveness of EU law within the Member States. While the provided context does not explicitly mention indirect effect, it is a fundamental principle in EU law that supports the uniform application of EU legal norms.

### e) Subsidiarity

Subsidiarity is a principle enshrined in the EU treaties that ensures decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen. It requires that the EU should only act when objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States. The legal basis of a measure is designed to fill gaps where no specific Treaty provisions confer powers on EU institutions, ensuring that actions are necessary to attain the objectives laid down by the Treaty. This principle is discussed in the context of ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union,"" where it is noted that the legal basis determines the procedures to be followed in adopting a measure.","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,
"Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B. Juan is Spanish and lives in Madrid with his Argentine wife Carmen. The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not? (Reason as with A(i) above), yet use question B facts.) ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation? (Include whether it can bring a court proceeding against Portugal.) Your assignment: Answer each sub-question from a EU law perspective. Support your answers by referring at every opportunity during your answers when relevant references are made of sources of EU law. Make clear which sub-question you are answering. Where appropriate provide specific examples (like in math class), not simply an unexplained answer. In other words describe several steps applying the law you have learned to these facts and demonstrating your understanding of how they fit within the broader context of the EU legal system functions.","### A(i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law?

The Italian public school's decision to deny Anna employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen is not in conformity with EU law. The principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality is a fundamental aspect of EU law, enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Specifically, Article 45 TFEU prohibits discrimination based on nationality within the EU, ensuring that EU citizens have the right to work in any Member State.

The requirement that Anna must be an Italian citizen to be employed directly interferes with her right to freedom of movement and residence, as well as her right to work in another Member State. This interference is discriminatory because it imposes a condition that disadvantages nationals of other Member States. As stated in ""Commission v Italian Republic,"" measures that draw distinctions based on residence or nationality are likely to operate mainly to the detriment of nationals of other Member States. This is because non-residents are often foreigners, and such measures can be seen as discriminatory even if they affect some nationals of the State in question.

Moreover, the Italian measure does not seem to be justified by a public interest that is not already safeguarded by the rules to which the service provider is subject in the Member State in which it is established. As noted in ""Commission v Spain,"" obstacles to the freedom to provide services can only be justified if the public interest relied on is not already safeguarded by the rules applicable in the service provider's home Member State. Since there is no indication that the Italian measure serves a legitimate public interest that is not already protected, it is likely to be unjustified.

### A(ii) What remedies might be available to her?

Anna has several remedies available to her under EU law. First, she can bring a court proceeding against the decision. She can initiate legal action in the Italian courts, invoking the principles of non-discrimination and freedom of movement as guaranteed by the TFEU. The Italian courts are obligated to apply EU law and ensure that national measures do not conflict with EU legal principles.

If the Italian courts do not provide a satisfactory remedy, Anna can also bring a case before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) under Article 267 TFEU. This allows national courts to refer questions of EU law to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. The CJEU can then provide guidance on how EU law should be interpreted and applied in Anna's case. Additionally, Anna can bring a case directly to the CJEU under Article 263 TFEU if she believes that the Italian measure is in breach of EU law. However, this route is more complex and typically requires the involvement of a Member State or an EU institution.

### B(i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not?

The Portuguese authority's decision to deny Carmen a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen is not in conformity with EU law. The right of entry into the territory of a Member State granted to a third-country national who is the spouse of a national of a Member State derives from the family relationship alone. As stated in ""Commission v Kingdom of Spain,"" the issuance of a residence permit to a third-country national who is the spouse of a Member State national is regarded as a measure by a Member State serving to prove the individual position of a national of a third country with regard to provisions of Community law. This means that the right of residence for the spouse of an EU citizen is a derived right, and Member States must facilitate this right.

The Portuguese measure directly interferes with Juan's right to freedom of movement and residence within the EU, as well as Carmen's derived right to reside with him. This interference is discriminatory because it imposes a condition that disadvantages non-EU nationals who are spouses of EU citizens. Such a measure is likely to operate mainly to the detriment of third-country nationals, which is discriminatory under EU law.

### B(ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation?

If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits to third-country nationals who are spouses of EU citizens, several actions can be taken at the EU level to remedy the situation. First, the European Commission can initiate infringement proceedings against Portugal under Article 258 TFEU. The Commission can issue a reasoned opinion to Portugal, outlining the breach of EU law and requesting that Portugal take corrective action within a specified period. If Portugal fails to comply, the Commission can bring the case before the CJEU.

The CJEU can then rule on whether Portugal has failed to fulfill its obligations under EU law and impose penalties if necessary. As stated in ""Commission v Italian Republic,"" the Court must determine whether a Member State has failed to fulfill its obligations by reference to the situation prevailing in the Member State at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion. The Court cannot take account of any subsequent changes, ensuring that the infringement is addressed promptly.

Additionally, the CJEU can provide guidance on how EU law should be interpreted and applied in similar cases, setting a precedent for other Member States. This ensures that the rights of EU citizens and their family members are protected across the EU, promoting the principles of non-discrimination and freedom of movement.","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","1) The duty of Member States to fulfil their EU obligations is enshrined in Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). This article obliges Member States to take appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union.

2) The European Union can take formal action against Italy if it suspects that the country is breaching Union law. The Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, has the power to initiate infringement proceedings against Member States that fail to comply with EU law. The process typically involves the following steps:
   - **Letter of Formal Notice**: The Commission sends a letter to the Member State outlining the alleged infringement and requesting a response within a specified period.
   - **Reasoned Opinion**: If the Member State does not comply or provide a satisfactory response, the Commission issues a reasoned opinion, detailing the legal grounds for the infringement and setting a deadline for the Member State to take corrective action.
   - **Referral to the Court of Justice**: If the Member State still does not comply after the reasoned opinion, the Commission can refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Court can then rule on whether the Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under EU law. This process is outlined in Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

3) If the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, and Italy does not comply with the judgment, several consequences can follow:
   - **Financial Penalties**: The Court can impose financial penalties on the Member State. These penalties can include a lump sum or periodic penalty payments until the infringement is rectified. This mechanism is provided for in Article 260(2) of the TFEU.
   - **Further Legal Action**: The Commission can take further legal action to ensure compliance, including additional infringement proceedings.
   - **Political and Reputational Consequences**: Non-compliance can also lead to political and reputational consequences for the Member State, as it may be seen as disregarding EU law and undermining the principles of the Union.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,

#### a) Summary of the Relevant Facts
In the case of ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix,"" the dispute centered on the adequacy of the statement of reasons provided in a contested decision. Frédéric Daffix was adversely affected by a decision made by the Commission of the European Communities. The core of the dispute was whether the decision provided sufficient reasons to allow Daffix to understand the basis of the decision and to enable the Court to review its legality.

#### b) Procedures in the Courts
The case was brought before the Court of Justice, which examined the adequacy of the statement of reasons in the contested decision. The Court reviewed the case-law to determine whether the decision met the necessary standards for transparency and clarity. The Court considered various precedents to establish the legal requirements for a proper statement of reasons.

#### c) Central Legal Issue(s)
The central legal issue discussed by the Court was whether the contested decision provided a proper statement of reasons. The Court had to determine if the decision included sufficient details to allow the affected party to understand the reasoning behind the decision and to enable the Court to review its legality.

#### d) Relevant Legal Rules
The Court relied on established case-law to outline the requirements for a proper statement of reasons. According to the case-law, a decision adversely affecting a person must state the reasons on which it is based. This requirement ensures that the person concerned can ascertain whether the decision is well-founded and allows the Court to review its legality. The Court referenced several cases, including ""Michel v Parliament,"" ""Lux v Court of Auditors,"" and ""Pérez-Mínguez Casariego v Commission,"" to support this principle.

#### e) Arguments of the Parties and Court Analysis
The Commission argued that the contested decision provided adequate reasons. Daffix contended that the decision lacked sufficient clarity and detail. The Court analyzed the decision by examining whether it met the standards set by previous case-law. The Court considered the necessity for the decision to include essential points of law and fact coherently and intelligibly, enabling the defendant to prepare a defense and the Court to rule on the application.

#### f) Conclusion
The Court concluded that the contested decision did not provide a proper statement of reasons. The decision lacked the necessary clarity and detail required by the case-law. Therefore, the Court found that the decision was not well-founded and could not be reviewed effectively.

### Legal Analysis

The case of ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"" is significant in the general scheme of EU law for several reasons. Firstly, it reinforces the principle that decisions adversely affecting individuals must be transparent and well-reasoned. This principle is crucial for ensuring the rule of law and protecting the rights of individuals within the EU.

Secondly, the case highlights the importance of procedural fairness in EU administrative law. The requirement for a proper statement of reasons ensures that individuals can understand the basis of decisions affecting them and can challenge those decisions if necessary. This transparency is essential for maintaining public trust in EU institutions.

Thirdly, the case underscores the role of the Court of Justice in reviewing the legality of EU decisions. The Court's analysis of the contested decision demonstrates its commitment to ensuring that EU institutions act within the bounds of the law. This role is vital for upholding the principles of accountability and the rule of law within the EU.

In conclusion, the case of ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"" is a landmark decision that emphasizes the importance of transparency, procedural fairness, and judicial review in EU administrative law. The principles established in this case continue to guide the actions of EU institutions and the decisions of the Court of Justice.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","### a) Difference Between Absolute and Relative Rights

In the context of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, fundamental rights can be categorized as either absolute or relative. An absolute right is one that cannot be restricted under any circumstances, whereas a relative right can be subject to limitations, provided that such limitations are proportionate and justified by legitimate aims.

An example of an absolute right in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is the right to be free from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment, as enshrined in Article 4. This right is non-derogable, meaning it cannot be restricted or limited under any circumstances.

In contrast, an example of a relative right is the right to freedom of expression, as outlined in Article 11. This right can be subject to certain limitations, such as those necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights of others, national security, public safety, or the prevention of crime.

### b) Reasons for the Court's Direction in 'Internationale Handelsgesellschaft'

In the case of 'Internationale Handelsgesellschaft', the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) declared that respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court. This direction was taken for several reasons, despite the court's previous hesitation to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the Member States' constitutional laws.

Firstly, the court recognized the need to ensure the protection of fundamental rights within the framework of Community law. This was essential to maintain the legitimacy and effectiveness of EU law, as it ensured that individuals' rights were safeguarded in the context of EU legal actions. By drawing inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, the court could provide a more robust and comprehensive protection of fundamental rights.

Secondly, the court acknowledged that the protection of fundamental rights was necessary to uphold the rule of law and the principles of democracy within the EU. By ensuring that fundamental rights were respected, the court could contribute to the development of a common legal and political culture across the Member States, fostering greater integration and cooperation.

### c) Principal Sources of EU Fundamental Rights

The three principal sources, or ""bills of rights,"" of EU fundamental rights are the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The ECHR is explicitly mentioned in the treaties as a significant source of inspiration for the protection of fundamental rights within the EU. The importance of the ECHR is underscored in various cases, such as 'European Parliament v Council of the European Union', where the court emphasized its special significance.

The constitutional traditions common to the Member States are also recognized as a crucial source of fundamental rights. The court draws inspiration from these traditions to ensure that the protection of fundamental rights is consistent with the values and principles shared by the Member States.

The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, proclaimed in 2000 and made legally binding by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, is the third principal source. The Charter explicitly states the fundamental rights that apply within the scope of EU law, providing a comprehensive and detailed framework for the protection of these rights.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","### A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not?

The decision by the Italian authorities to refuse Maria's residence renewal on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation may not be in conformity with EU law. According to the principles established in ""Lawrie-Blum"" and ""Collins"", a person who performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for remuneration is considered a worker. This includes activities that are real and genuine, excluding those that are purely marginal and ancillary. Therefore, if Maria's 15 hours of work per week are considered genuine and not marginal, she should be entitled to the freedom of movement as a worker.

Additionally, the case ""Orfanopoulos and Oliveri"" clarifies that migrant workers who are nationals of a Member State have the right of residence as long as they remain workers or are seeking employment. This means that as long as Maria is actively engaged in work, even if it is part-time, she should be able to renew her residence permit. The Italian authorities' decision to refuse her renewal based solely on the reduction in her working hours may infringe upon her rights under Article 39 EC, which ensures the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality regarding employment and working conditions.

### B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.

Maria does have other options beyond being considered an 'EU worker' to reside in Italy. According to the case ""Orfanopoulos and Oliveri"", her right of residence is subject to the condition that she remains a worker or, where relevant, a person seeking employment. However, if she does not meet these criteria, she might still derive her right from other provisions of Community law. For instance, if Maria is a student or self-employed, she might qualify under different provisions of EU law that allow for residence rights. Additionally, if she has sufficient financial means and comprehensive sickness insurance, she could potentially qualify as an economically inactive person under Directive 2004/38/EC, which allows EU citizens to reside in another Member State for more than three months without being economically active.

Moreover, if Maria can demonstrate that she is actively seeking employment, she might still be entitled to reside in Italy under the provisions of Community law that allow for residence rights for job seekers. The case ""Antonissen"" supports this, stating that the right of residence is subject to the condition that the person remains a worker or is seeking employment. Therefore, if Maria can show that she is actively looking for work, she might still be able to renew her residence permit.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,

#### a) Summary of the Relevant Facts

The case of Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA revolves around a dispute between Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA, and Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA. The specific facts of the case are not provided in the context, but generally, such disputes often involve issues related to public procurement, service contracts, or regulatory compliance within the EU framework. The parties likely disagreed over the interpretation or application of EU law in the context of their contractual or regulatory obligations.

#### b) Procedures Occurred in What Courts and Why

The procedures in this case likely involved preliminary references from national courts to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). This is a common procedure under Article 234 EC (now Article 267 TFEU), where national courts seek clarification on the interpretation of EU law to resolve disputes before them. The national court would have identified a need for a preliminary ruling to ensure the correct application of EU law in the specific circumstances of the case. The CJEU would then provide a ruling on the interpretation of EU law, which the national court would apply to the facts of the case.

#### c) Central Legal Issue(s) Discussed by the Court of Justice

The central legal issue discussed by the CJEU in this case would have been the interpretation of a specific provision of EU law relevant to the dispute between the parties. This could involve questions related to public procurement directives, service contracts, or regulatory compliance. The national court would have sought clarification on how to apply these provisions to the facts of the case.

#### d) Relevant Legal Rules (Provisions of EU Law)

The relevant legal rules in this case would depend on the specific provisions of EU law at issue. Commonly, these could include directives on public procurement, such as Directive 2004/18/EC, or regulations related to service contracts and regulatory compliance. The CJEU would have interpreted these provisions to provide guidance to the national court.

#### e) How the Parties Argued and the Court of Justice Analysed

The parties would have presented their arguments based on their interpretation of the relevant EU law provisions. Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA, might have argued for a specific interpretation that favored their position, while Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA would have presented counterarguments. The CJEU would have analyzed these arguments in the context of established case law and the principles of EU law. For instance, the CJEU might have referred to previous cases such as ""Bosman"" and ""Stichting Zuid-Hollandse Milieufederatie"" to support its analysis of the cooperation between national courts and the CJEU.

#### f) Conclusion Regarding the Issue(s)

The CJEU would have provided a ruling on the interpretation of the relevant EU law provision, guiding the national court on how to apply it to the facts of the case. This ruling would have been based on the principles of EU law and the specific circumstances of the dispute. The national court would then apply this interpretation to resolve the dispute between the parties.

### Legal Analysis of the Importance of the Case

The case of Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA is significant in the general scheme of EU law for several reasons. Firstly, it underscores the importance of the preliminary reference procedure under Article 234 EC (now Article 267 TFEU) in ensuring the uniform application of EU law across Member States. This procedure allows national courts to seek clarification on the interpretation of EU law, thereby promoting legal certainty and consistency.

Secondly, the case highlights the role of the CJEU in interpreting EU law and providing guidance to national courts. As seen in cases such as ""Grundig Italiana SpA v Ministero delle Finanze"" and ""Ministero dell'Industria, del Commercio e dell'Artigianato v Lucchini SpA"", the CJEU is bound to give a ruling on questions submitted by national courts concerning the interpretation of EU law. This ensures that EU law is applied correctly and consistently across the Member States.

Thirdly, the case reflects the principles of cooperation between national courts and the CJEU. As established in ""Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA"", it is the national court's responsibility to determine the need for a preliminary ruling and the relevance of the questions submitted. This cooperation is crucial for the effective functioning of the EU legal system and the protection of individual rights.

Furthermore, the case touches on the importance of the statement of reasons required by Article 253 EC (now Article 296 TFEU) and Article 190 of the Treaty. As seen in ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities"" and ""Italian Republic v Council of the European Union"", the statement of reasons must be clear and unequivocal, enabling the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for the measure and the competent court to exercise its power of review. This principle ensures transparency and accountability in the decision-making process of EU institutions.

Lastly, the case reflects the CJEU's jurisdiction to review the legal classification of facts and the legal inferences drawn by the Court of First Instance, as seen in ""European Parliament v Carlo Ripa di Meana, Leoluca Orlando and Gastone Parigi"". This jurisdiction is crucial for ensuring the correct application of EU law and the protection of individual rights.

In conclusion, the case of Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA is important in the general scheme of EU law as it underscores the principles of cooperation between national courts and the CJEU, the importance of the preliminary reference procedure, and the role of the CJEU in interpreting EU law. It also highlights the principles of transparency, accountability, and legal certainty in the application of EU law.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"Below, I provide brief definitions and explanations of the requested EU law terms and concepts, drawing on the principles and case law referenced in the provided context where applicable, and explaining the concepts in a general sense where specific details are not directly covered.

a) **Indirect Challenge of an EU Act**: An indirect challenge of an EU act refers to a legal mechanism whereby the validity of an EU measure is questioned not through a direct action for annulment before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), but indirectly through national courts. This often occurs when an individual or entity challenges a national measure implementing an EU act, raising questions about the legality of the underlying EU act. The national court may then refer the matter to the CJEU via a preliminary ruling to assess the validity of the EU act. While the provided context does not directly address this concept, it aligns with the broader principle of ensuring the effectiveness of EU law, as seen in cases like ""Reyners"" and ""Commission v Greece"", where the limits on Member State actions are emphasized to protect Treaty provisions.

b) **National Procedural Autonomy**: National procedural autonomy refers to the principle that Member States are generally free to determine their own procedural rules for the enforcement of EU law within their legal systems, provided these rules do not undermine the effectiveness of EU law or render its application impossible or excessively difficult. This principle ensures a balance between national sovereignty and the uniform application of EU law. Although not explicitly detailed in the context, this concept relates to the discussions in cases such as ""Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union"", where the implementation of EU rules at the national level is addressed, implying a degree of autonomy in how rules are applied or drawn up.

c) **The Principle of Supremacy**: The principle of supremacy establishes that EU law takes precedence over conflicting national laws of Member States. This means that if there is a conflict between national legislation and EU law, the latter prevails, and national courts must set aside any conflicting domestic provisions. This principle is crucial for ensuring the uniform application and effectiveness of EU law across the Union. While not directly mentioned in the provided context, it underpins the discussions in cases like ""European Commission v Kingdom of Belgium"" and others, where the CJEU emphasizes the limits on Member States’ unilateral actions to protect Treaty provisions such as freedom of establishment, reflecting the overriding nature of EU law.

d) **Non-Legislative EU Act**: A non-legislative EU act refers to a legal measure adopted by EU institutions that does not follow the ordinary or special legislative procedures outlined in the Treaties. These acts can include implementing or delegated acts, often adopted to provide detailed rules or specific applications of legislative acts. The context in ""Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union"" touches on this concept by discussing the notion of implementation, which includes drawing up implementing rules and applying them to specific cases, indicating the nature of non-legislative acts as tools for practical application of broader EU legislation.

e) **Field of Application of EU Fundamental Rights**: The field of application of EU fundamental rights refers to the scope within which these rights, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, are applicable. These rights apply primarily to EU institutions and bodies, and to Member States only when they are implementing EU law or acting within the scope of EU law. This ensures that fundamental rights are protected in areas governed by EU competence. While the provided context does not directly address fundamental rights, the principle of ensuring the effectiveness of EU law, as highlighted in cases like ""European Commission v Republic of Austria"", indirectly relates to this concept by emphasizing the boundaries within which Member States must operate under EU law, including respect for fundamental rights when applicable.

These explanations provide a foundational understanding of the terms within the framework of EU law, reflecting the principles of effectiveness and uniform application that are central to the case law referenced in the context.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","In the dispute between Happy Times and Big Fun regarding the sale of the toy gun 'Bang' in Sweden, the central issue is whether Big Fun, a Danish company, can rely on the Safe Toys Directive to contest the application of Swedish law banning toys imitating firearms. The Safe Toys Directive, as a maximum harmonization act, aims to regulate all aspects of the production, marketing, and sale of toys across Member States, with the explicit goal of facilitating trade by reducing differences in national rules that hamper the internal market. It limits the grounds for banning toys to situations where they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use.' However, Sweden has failed to implement this directive despite the expiration of the implementation period. To assess whether Big Fun can invoke the directive, we must consider relevant EU legal principles and case law concerning the free movement of goods and the effects of unimplemented directives, drawing on the provided context.

The starting point is the principle of free movement of goods, a cornerstone of the EU internal market, which prohibits measures that impede trade between Member States. As highlighted in ""Proceedings for compulsory reconstruction against Smanor SA,"" even measures that do not outright ban imports but make marketing more difficult can indirectly hinder trade. The Swedish ban on toys imitating firearms, while applied without distinction to domestic and imported products, could still be seen as a barrier to trade, especially since it conflicts with the harmonized rules of the Safe Toys Directive. Furthermore, in ""Criminal proceedings against Gunnar Nilsson, Per Olov Hagelgren and Solweig Arrborn,"" the Court clarified that national rules applying equally to domestic and imported products may not fall under the prohibition of Article 30 (now Article 34 TFEU) if they do not disproportionately affect imported goods. However, given the directive’s aim to harmonize toy safety rules and limit bans, the Swedish legislation might still be challenged as an unjustified restriction, particularly if it exceeds the directive’s stricter criteria for prohibiting sales.

Regarding the direct invocability of the Safe Toys Directive, EU law generally holds that directives do not have horizontal direct effect, meaning they cannot be directly relied upon by one private party against another in national courts if not implemented. Big Fun, as a private entity, is thus unlikely to directly enforce the directive against Happy Times in a Swedish court due to Sweden’s failure to transpose it. However, the principle of consistent interpretation requires national courts to interpret domestic law in line with EU directives as far as possible. Additionally, Big Fun could argue that the Swedish ban constitutes a disguised restriction on trade, as discussed in ""Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG v Centrafarm Vertriebsgesellschaft Pharmazeutischer Erzeugnisse mbH,"" where the Court examined whether certain actions could mask barriers to trade under the guise of legitimate rights. This principle is reiterated in ""Boehringer Ingelheim KG and others v Swingward Ltd and Dowelhurst Ltd,"" emphasizing that derogations from free movement cannot be accepted if they disguise trade restrictions. If the Swedish ban is deemed disproportionate or beyond the directive’s criteria of 'obviously dangerous in normal use,' Big Fun might challenge its application as an unjustified barrier.

Moreover, the context from ""The Queen, on the application of: Swedish Match AB and Swedish Match UK Ltd v Secretary of State for Health"" indicates that Member States may be required to authorize marketing under certain conditions or even prohibit products, but such measures must align with EU law objectives, such as those in harmonization directives. Since the Safe Toys Directive sets a clear standard for banning toys, Big Fun could argue that Sweden’s broader prohibition exceeds permissible limits under EU law. While Big Fun cannot directly rely on the directive in a horizontal dispute, it could potentially invoke the supremacy of EU law and request the national court to refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a preliminary ruling on the compatibility of Swedish law with EU principles, especially given the directive’s maximum harmonization nature.

In conclusion, while Big Fun faces limitations in directly relying on the Safe Toys Directive due to its unimplemented status and the horizontal nature of the dispute, it can still challenge the Swedish ban by invoking the principle of free movement of goods and arguing that the national rule constitutes an unjustified or disguised restriction on trade, drawing on principles from cases like ""Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG v Centrafarm"" and ""Boehringer Ingelheim KG and others v Swingward Ltd and Dowelhurst Ltd."" Big Fun’s strongest strategy would be to urge the Swedish court to interpret national law in light of the directive or seek a CJEU ruling on the matter, leveraging the directive’s harmonization objectives to contest the broader scope of the Swedish prohibition.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","Below, I provide brief definitions and explanations of the requested EU law terms and concepts, drawing on the relevant legal authorities and principles as provided in the context. Each concept is supported by references to Treaty articles and case law where applicable.

**a) Special Legislative Procedure**  
The special legislative procedure in EU law refers to a specific process for adopting certain legislative acts, distinct from the ordinary legislative procedure, where the roles of the European Parliament and the Council may vary, often requiring unanimity in the Council or consultation with the Parliament. While the provided context does not directly define this term, it touches on the importance of legal basis in determining procedural requirements in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"". Specifically, it is noted that the legal basis of a measure dictates the procedure to be followed for its adoption. This implies that the special legislative procedure would be determined by the specific Treaty provisions applicable to a given measure, potentially involving multiple legal bases when a measure pursues several inseparably linked objectives.

**b) Measures Having Equivalent Effect to Quantitative Restrictions (MEQRs)**  
MEQRs are national rules or legislation enacted by Member States that can hinder, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade, even if they are not outright quantitative restrictions like quotas. This concept is rooted in Articles 28 and 30 EC (now Articles 34 and 36 TFEU) and is extensively elaborated in case law. In ""Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany"", it is clarified that such measures encompass any legislation capable of obstructing trade within the EU. This principle is reinforced by landmark rulings like ""Dassonville"", which established that all rules hindering trade fall under this prohibition. Additionally, in ""Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Austria"" and other cases, this broad interpretation is consistently applied. However, as noted in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands"", such measures may be justified on public interest grounds under Article 30 EC or by imperative requirements, provided they are appropriate and necessary for achieving their objective without exceeding what is required.

**c) Concerted Practices**  
The concept of concerted practices refers to a form of coordination between undertakings that, while not amounting to a formal agreement, still restricts competition by replacing independent action with coordinated behavior. Unfortunately, the provided context does not address this term or related competition law principles. Therefore, I am unable to provide a definition or explanation supported by the given material. If further context or case law related to competition law is provided, I would be happy to elaborate on this concept.

**d) Enforcement Actions/Infringement Proceedings**  
Enforcement actions, also known as infringement proceedings, are legal actions initiated by the European Commission against a Member State for failing to fulfill its obligations under EU law, typically under Articles 258 or 260 TFEU. While the provided context does not explicitly define this term, cases such as ""Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany"", ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands"", and ""Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Austria"" illustrate the Commission’s role in challenging national measures that violate EU law, such as those constituting MEQRs. These proceedings aim to ensure compliance with Treaty obligations and often involve the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling on whether a Member State has breached EU law.

**e) Proportionality**  
Proportionality is a fundamental principle in EU law that requires measures, particularly those restricting rights or freedoms (such as intra-Community trade), to be appropriate for achieving their intended objective and not to go beyond what is necessary to attain that objective. This principle is highlighted in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands"", where it is stated that national legislation constituting an MEQR can be justified only if it is suitable for securing the public interest objective pursued and does not exceed what is necessary. This ensures a balance between the aims of the measure and the impact on EU law principles, such as the free movement of goods, as supported by cases like ""Radiosistemi"" and ""ATRAL"" referenced in the context.

In summary, while most of these concepts are grounded in the provided case law and Treaty provisions, the absence of specific material on concerted practices limits a full explanation of that term. The other concepts are clearly tied to foundational EU law principles, particularly regarding trade restrictions and legislative procedures, as illustrated by the relevant case law.","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law.","In addressing Cynthia’s situation under EU law, I will analyze each aspect of her case based on relevant principles and case law, focusing on her status as an EU worker, access to public service positions, and potential discrimination in private employment.

**a) Residence Permit Renewal and EU Worker Status**  
Regarding the Belgian authorities’ decision to deny Cynthia’s residence permit renewal on the grounds that her reduced working hours (10 hours per week as a private chemistry teacher) disqualify her from being considered an “EU worker,” this stance appears inconsistent with EU law. Under EU law, the right of residence for EU citizens is tied to their status as workers, as outlined in directives such as Directive 68/360. While the context does not specify a minimum hour threshold for qualifying as a worker, the principle of free movement and residence for EU workers is fundamental. In “Mouvement contre le racisme, l’antisémitisme et la xénophobie ASBL (MRAX) v Belgian State,” the Court emphasized that Member States must facilitate the right of residence for those who meet the criteria under relevant directives, without imposing undue restrictions. Although Cynthia’s employment has shifted from full-time to part-time, she is still engaged in genuine and effective economic activity. Therefore, Belgium’s refusal to recognize her as a worker based solely on reduced hours likely contravenes the spirit of EU law on free movement and residence rights for EU citizens.

**b) Rejection from Public Service Position at the Ministry**  
Cynthia’s rejection from a position at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media on the grounds of not being a Belgian citizen raises issues under EU law, specifically concerning access to public service roles. According to Article 39(4) EC, as discussed in “Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon,” Member States are permitted to restrict certain public service positions to their nationals, particularly those involving a special relationship of allegiance to the state and reciprocity of rights and duties tied to nationality. This principle is further supported by references in the same case to prior rulings like “Commission v Belgium,” which affirm that such restrictions are lawful for roles integral to national sovereignty or public interest. Assuming the Ministry position falls within this category, Belgium’s decision to limit the role to Belgian citizens aligns with EU law under the exception provided by Article 39(4) EC. However, if the role does not involve such a special relationship, this restriction could be challenged as discriminatory under the broader free movement provisions of Article 39(1) to (3) EC.

**c) Rejection from Private Academy Due to Nationality and Linguistic Requirements**  
Finally, Cynthia’s rejection from a private academy as a chemistry tutor due to her nationality and failure to meet linguistic requirements (advanced knowledge of other EU languages) must be assessed under EU anti-discrimination and free movement principles. As highlighted in “Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium,” restrictions based on nationality that exclude nationals of other Member States from opportunities available to host state nationals constitute discrimination prohibited under Article 7 of the Treaty (now Article 18 TFEU). Rejecting Cynthia explicitly because she is not Belgian is a clear violation of this principle. Regarding the linguistic requirement, while employers may set language proficiency standards if they are necessary for the job, such requirements must be proportionate and justified by objective reasons. The academy’s argument that advanced knowledge of other EU languages is needed to teach exchange students could be seen as a legitimate occupational requirement. However, if this criterion disproportionately disadvantages non-Belgian applicants like Cynthia and is not strictly necessary for the role of a chemistry tutor, it could still be deemed indirectly discriminatory under EU law principles of equal treatment.

In conclusion, Belgium’s stance on Cynthia’s residence permit renewal likely conflicts with EU worker rights, the rejection from the Ministry position may be permissible under specific public service exceptions, and the private academy’s rejection based on nationality is contrary to EU law, with the linguistic requirement needing further scrutiny for proportionality. These assessments are grounded in the principles of free movement, non-discrimination, and relevant case law such as “MRAX v Belgian State” and “Commission v Belgium.”","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","As a judge in the local court of Fantasia adjudicating the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough, I must address the EU law-related issues at the heart of this case, particularly the interplay between national legislation and EU directives, and the principle of direct effect. The central question is whether Good Enough can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive to set aside paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety, which requires the inclusion of a shelter in buildings designed for more than 10 people, a requirement not reflected in the Directive’s harmonized standards.

The Safe Building Directive, adopted in 2015 and entering into force on June 1, 2015, aims to harmonize building standards across Member States to facilitate trade in construction work within the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the Directive provide detailed standards for good building practices, and crucially, Article 20 explicitly prohibits Member States from introducing additional requirements beyond those specified in the Directive. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, through the 2016 Construction Act, which mirrors Articles 5-15 but did not repeal or amend the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Good Enough argues that the failure to repeal paragraph 138 of the national law is a mere oversight and that Article 20 of the Directive should prevail, rendering the national requirement for a shelter inapplicable. Big Money counters that the 1948 Law remains in force as of January 1, 2019, the relevant date stipulated in their contract, and that it addresses a distinct issue of public safety not covered by the Directive.

Under EU law, directives are binding as to the result to be achieved but leave the choice of form and methods to Member States. However, once the deadline for transposition passes—here, December 31, 2016—individuals may, under certain conditions, invoke provisions of a directive against the state if the state has failed to implement it correctly or fully. Although the provided context does not directly address the principle of direct effect, it is a fundamental tenet of EU law that I must consider. Good Enough’s argument hinges on the idea that Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive has a clear, precise, and unconditional obligation that Fantasia has not fulfilled by maintaining the conflicting national law. However, this case involves a horizontal dispute between two private parties, and EU law generally does not allow directives to have direct effect in such situations, as they are primarily binding on Member States.

Turning to the principle of legal certainty, as highlighted in ""Belgische Staat v Cobelfret NV"", the Court of Justice has emphasized that only in exceptional circumstances can reliance on an interpreted provision be restricted, provided that parties acted in good faith and there is a risk of serious difficulties. In this case, Big Money relied on the national law in force on January 1, 2019, as per the contract, and there is no indication of bad faith on their part. Good Enough, while arguing that the national law should be set aside due to the Directive, must contend with the fact that the 1948 Law on Public Safety remains in effect and was not repealed or amended during Fantasia’s implementation of the Directive. The principle of legal certainty thus leans toward upholding the existing national legal framework as understood by the contracting parties at the relevant time.

Moreover, while the context in cases such as ""Kingdom of Spain v Commission of the European Communities"", ""Portuguese Republic v Commission of the European Communities"", and ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities"" deals with the adequacy of reasoning in Commission decisions on clearance of accounts, it underscores a broader principle of transparency and awareness in legal processes. By analogy, both parties in this dispute were or should have been aware of the existing national legislation at the time of contracting, and Good Enough’s assumption that the national law is a mere oversight does not automatically override its legal validity.

Additionally, the argument by Big Money that the 1948 Law addresses public safety—a potentially distinct area from the harmonized building standards of the Directive—raises a question of scope. In ""Jobra Vermögensverwaltungs-Gesellschaft mbH v Finanzamt Amstetten Melk Scheibbs"", the Court acknowledged that certain national interests, when balanced with other justifications, could be legitimate, though not directly applicable to the present circumstances. While the Directive aims to harmonize standards, it is not clear from the provided information whether public safety requirements like shelters fall entirely outside its scope, and I must consider whether Fantasia’s retention of such a law could be seen as a permissible exception or a failure of implementation.

In resolving this issue, I find that Good Enough cannot directly rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive to set aside paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety in this horizontal dispute. The national law was in force on the contractually relevant date, and legal certainty, as reflected in ""Belgische Staat v Cobelfret NV"", supports Big Money’s reliance on the existing legal framework. However, I recognize the potential conflict between the Directive and national law, and thus, I would refer a question to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling on whether Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive precludes the application of national public safety requirements not addressed in Articles 5-15, and whether such a provision could be invoked indirectly in a dispute between private parties through the principle of consistent interpretation. Pending such clarification, I must uphold the national law as it stands, finding Good Enough in breach of contract for failing to include the shelter as required by paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","Below, I provide brief definitions and explanations of the requested EU law terms and concepts, drawing on the relevant legal principles and case law from the provided context where applicable. Each concept is addressed with reference to the foundational ideas and judicial interpretations as reflected in the cases mentioned.

a) **The Ordinary Legislative Procedure (OLP):** The ordinary legislative procedure is the main legislative process in the European Union for adopting EU legislation, involving equal participation of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. While the provided context does not directly define OLP, insights from cases like ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"" emphasize the importance of the legal basis of a measure in determining the procedure to be followed for its adoption. This underscores that the OLP, as the standard procedure, is tied to specific legal bases in the Treaties, ensuring a structured and democratic process for law-making within the EU framework.

b) **State Liability:** State liability refers to the principle under EU law whereby Member States can be held accountable for damages caused to individuals due to breaches of EU law, particularly when such breaches result from legislative or administrative actions. The case ""Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others"" elaborates on this concept by highlighting that the rules governing liability, especially for legislative measures, consider factors such as the complexity of regulated situations and the discretion available to the state. This principle ensures that Member States are responsible for ensuring compliance with EU obligations and compensating for harm caused by non-compliance.

c) **The Preliminary Ruling Procedure:** The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism under EU law that allows national courts to refer questions on the interpretation or validity of EU law to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to ensure uniform application across Member States. Although not explicitly detailed in the provided context, the general framework of judicial cooperation and jurisdiction division, as mentioned in ""European Commission v Systran SA and Systran Luxembourg SA,"" supports the idea that such a procedure is vital for maintaining coherence between national and EU judicial systems. This process enables the CJEU to provide authoritative guidance, ensuring consistent legal interpretation throughout the EU.

d) **Indirect Effect:** Indirect effect is a principle of EU law whereby national courts are required to interpret national legislation, as far as possible, in a manner consistent with EU directives, even if the directive has not been directly implemented. While the provided context does not specifically address indirect effect, the broader theme of ensuring the effectiveness of EU law, as seen in ""European Commission v Republic of Austria,"" aligns with this concept. The case emphasizes that Member States must not frustrate Treaty provisions, such as freedom of establishment, through unilateral actions, reflecting the underlying obligation to align national law with EU objectives, a key aspect of indirect effect.

e) **Subsidiarity:** Subsidiarity is a fundamental principle of EU law that dictates that the EU should only act where objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States at the national, regional, or local level, and can be better achieved at the Union level. Although not directly discussed in the provided context, the principle is implicitly supported by cases like ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union,"" which discuss the necessity of EU action to attain Treaty objectives when Member States lack the power to act effectively. Subsidiarity ensures that decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizens, balancing EU intervention with national autonomy.

These explanations draw on the principles and judicial interpretations from the provided case law to frame each concept within the broader context of EU legal obligations and institutional roles, ensuring a coherent understanding of their application.","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,

I will structure my response by clearly labeling each sub-question (A(i), A(ii), B(i), B(ii)) and providing detailed reasoning with references to relevant case law from the context, ensuring that each step of the legal analysis is supported and explained within the broader framework of EU law.

**A(i): Is the Italian company's decision to deny Anna employment based on her nationality in conformity with EU law?**

In assessing whether the Italian company's decision to deny Anna, a Swedish citizen, employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen complies with EU law, we must consider the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, a cornerstone of the EU legal order. According to the case law in ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"", measures that distinguish based on nationality or residence are likely to be discriminatory, as they often disadvantage nationals of other Member States. Specifically, the Court has held that such measures are liable to operate mainly to the detriment of non-nationals, since non-residents are predominantly foreigners, and it is irrelevant if the measure also affects some nationals of the Member State in question. In Anna’s case, the outright denial of employment based on her Swedish nationality clearly constitutes a direct form of discrimination, as it places her at a disadvantage compared to Italian nationals.

Furthermore, this decision interferes with Anna’s fundamental right to freedom of movement and the freedom to provide or seek services and employment across Member States. As highlighted in ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"", a condition such as residence or nationality directly negates the freedom to provide services by making it impossible for persons established in other Member States to engage in certain activities. By extension, denying employment based on nationality impedes Anna’s ability to exercise her rights as an EU citizen to work in another Member State, which is a fundamental aspect of the internal market.

Regarding justification, EU law allows for obstacles to fundamental freedoms only if they pursue a legitimate public interest and are proportionate, provided that the interest is not already safeguarded by rules in the worker’s home Member State. As noted in ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"", any justification must ensure that the public interest is not already protected by equivalent measures in the service provider’s state of establishment. In Anna’s scenario, there is no indication that the Italian company’s decision is based on a legitimate public interest, such as public security or health. Instead, it appears to be a blanket exclusion based solely on nationality, which is unlikely to meet the strict criteria for justification under EU law. Therefore, the Italian company’s decision is not in conformity with EU law, as it violates the principle of non-discrimination and interferes with Anna’s fundamental rights without a valid justification.

**A(ii): What remedies might be available to Anna?**

Anna, as an EU citizen, has several remedies available to challenge the discriminatory decision by the Italian company. Under EU law, individuals can bring court proceedings to enforce their rights derived from EU treaties and legislation. Anna can initiate legal action in Italian national courts to contest the employment denial, relying on the principle of direct effect of EU law, which allows individuals to invoke EU provisions before national courts. She can argue that the company’s decision violates her rights under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), specifically the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality and her freedom of movement as an EU citizen, as supported by the principles in ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"". National courts are obliged to apply EU law and set aside conflicting national provisions, ensuring that Anna’s rights are upheld.

Additionally, if the national court is uncertain about the interpretation of EU law, it may (or must, if it is a court of last instance) refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 TFEU. This mechanism ensures consistent application of EU law across Member States. Anna could also lodge a complaint with the European Commission, which has the authority to investigate potential breaches of EU law by Member States or private entities acting under national rules. If the Commission finds a systemic issue, it could initiate infringement proceedings against Italy, although this would not directly remedy Anna’s individual situation. Primarily, her most direct remedy lies in pursuing a case in Italian courts to seek redress, such as reinstatement or compensation for the discriminatory treatment.

**B(i): Is the Portuguese authority’s decision to deny Carmen a residence permit in conformity with EU law?**

Turning to Juan and Carmen’s situation, we must evaluate whether the Portuguese authority’s decision to deny Carmen, an Argentine national married to Juan, a Spanish citizen, a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen complies with EU law. According to the principles established in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Spain"", the right of entry and residence for a third-country national who is the spouse of an EU citizen derives solely from the family relationship. The issuance of a residence permit is not a measure creating rights but rather a procedural step to confirm the individual’s position under EU law. In Carmen’s case, as the spouse of Juan, an EU citizen exercising his freedom of movement by planning to relocate to Portugal, she is entitled to reside with him in the host Member State under EU rules on family reunification and free movement.

The Portuguese authority’s decision to deny Carmen a residence permit based on her non-EU nationality directly contradicts this principle. It interferes with Juan’s fundamental right to free movement as an EU citizen, as it effectively hinders his ability to move to and reside in Portugal with his spouse. This creates an obstacle to the exercise of EU rights, which is not permissible unless justified by a legitimate public interest. No such justification is apparent in the facts provided, and the decision appears to be a blanket exclusion based on nationality rather than an assessment of individual circumstances. Therefore, the Portuguese authority’s decision is not in conformity with EU law, as it violates the rights of family members of EU citizens to reside in the host Member State, as clarified in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Spain"".

**B(ii): If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one, what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation?**

If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits to third-country national spouses of EU citizens, such as in Carmen’s case, several actions can be taken at the EU level to address this systemic breach of EU law. The European Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, has the authority to initiate infringement proceedings against Portugal under Article 258 TFEU. This process begins with the Commission issuing a reasoned opinion, outlining how Portugal has failed to fulfill its obligations under EU law, specifically regarding the rights of family members of EU citizens to reside in the host Member State, as supported by the principles in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Spain"". As noted in ""Commission of the European Communities v Portuguese Republic"" and ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"", the assessment of whether a Member State has failed to fulfill its obligations is based on the situation at the end of the period specified in the reasoned opinion, and subsequent changes cannot be taken into account by the Court.

If Portugal does not comply with the reasoned opinion within the specified timeframe, the Commission can bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a ruling. A judgment finding Portugal in breach would oblige the Member State to rectify the situation, potentially by amending national laws or practices to align with EU law. Additionally, as highlighted in ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities"", internal difficulties cannot justify a Member State’s failure to comply with EU obligations, meaning Portugal cannot evade responsibility due to domestic challenges. Beyond court proceedings, the Commission could also engage in dialogue with Portuguese authorities to encourage compliance before escalating to litigation. Individuals like Juan and Carmen can also contribute to EU-level action by lodging complaints with the Commission, prompting an investigation into systemic issues. Ultimately, the primary EU-level remedy lies in the Commission’s power to pursue infringement proceedings to ensure Portugal adheres to EU law on family reunification and free movement.","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","1) The duty of Member States to fulfill their obligations under EU law is enshrined in Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). This article establishes the principle of sincere cooperation, requiring Member States to take all appropriate measures to ensure the fulfillment of obligations arising from the Treaties or resulting from acts of the EU institutions, such as directives. In the context of Italy's failure to submit the required report on air pollution monitoring under Directive (EU) 2016/2284 by the deadline of 1 July 2022, this principle obliges Italy to comply with the reporting requirements set out in Articles 9 and 10.4 of the Directive.

2) Yes, the European Union can take formal action against Italy if it suspects a breach of Union law, specifically through an infringement procedure under Articles 258 and 260 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Under Article 258 TFEU, the European Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, can initiate proceedings if it believes a Member State has failed to fulfill an obligation. This process begins with a letter of formal notice to Italy, requesting an explanation for the delay in submitting the report required by Directive (EU) 2016/2284. If Italy does not respond satisfactorily, the Commission may issue a reasoned opinion, setting a deadline for compliance. If Italy still fails to comply, the Commission can refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a ruling on whether Italy has breached its obligations. This formal action mirrors the approach seen in cases like ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"", where the Commission brought proceedings against Italy for non-compliance with waste management obligations under Directive 75/442, highlighting the Commission’s role in ensuring adherence to EU law.

3) If the case is referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court finds that Italy has failed to fulfill its obligations under the Treaties by not complying with the reporting requirements of Directive (EU) 2016/2284, and Italy subsequently refuses to comply with the CJEU’s judgment, further action can be taken under Article 260 TFEU. According to this provision, if a Member State does not comply with a CJEU judgment, the Commission may bring the case back before the Court. The CJEU can then impose financial penalties, such as a lump sum or periodic penalty payments, to compel compliance. This mechanism ensures that Member States adhere to the Court’s rulings, reflecting the binding nature of EU law as emphasized in prior cases like ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"", where persistent non-compliance with environmental directives was addressed through judicial oversight. These penalties serve as a deterrent and a means to enforce the rule of law within the Union, ensuring that Italy addresses its failure to report on air pollution monitoring as required.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,

Given the context provided, I will address the decisions across the multiple cases mentioned, focusing on the recurring themes and legal principles discussed in each. Since the context includes several cases, I will summarize the key elements for each where relevant facts and legal issues are provided, ensuring a comprehensive overview of the disputes, procedures, legal issues, rules, arguments, and conclusions.

#### a) Summary of Relevant Facts
In ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"", the dispute involves the Commission and an individual, Frédéric Daffix, concerning a contested decision that adversely affected him. The specific subject matter of the decision is not detailed in the context, but the focus is on whether the decision provided a proper statement of reasons. In ""Commission of the European Communities v Ireland"", ""Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Finland"", ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"", and ""Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union"", the disputes center on procedural compliance with the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, specifically whether applications filed by the Commission or other parties adequately stated the subject matter and pleas in law. These cases involve Member States or EU institutions as defendants, with the Commission alleging procedural deficiencies in legal proceedings. Lastly, in ""Commission of the European Communities v Département du Loiret and Scott SA"", the issue revolves around the adequacy of the statement of reasons under Article 253 EC for a measure adopted by an EU institution, affecting the named parties. In ""Z v European Parliament"", the dispute concerns an appeal process, focusing on the precision required in identifying contested elements of a judgment.

#### b) Procedures and Courts Involved
These cases were adjudicated by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), with some references to prior rulings by the Court of First Instance (now General Court) as seen in ""Commission of the European Communities v Département du Loiret and Scott SA"". The procedures generally involve direct actions or appeals brought before the CJEU, often initiated by the Commission against Member States or individuals against EU institutions. The reasons for these proceedings vary: in cases like ""Commission of the European Communities v Ireland"", the focus is on ensuring procedural clarity in applications under Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure. In ""Z v European Parliament"", the procedure involves an appeal under Article 51 of the EC Statute, emphasizing the need for precision in appeal submissions. The CJEU reviews these cases to ensure compliance with EU procedural and substantive law, often building on its prior case-law.

#### c) Central Legal Issues Discussed by the Court of Justice
The central legal issues across these cases revolve around procedural and substantive requirements in EU law. In ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"", the key issue is whether the contested decision provided a sufficient statement of reasons to allow the affected person to assess its validity and enable judicial review [paragraph 32]. In the cases involving Ireland, Finland, Italy, and the European Parliament and Council, the primary issue is compliance with Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure, requiring applications to clearly state the subject matter and pleas in law to facilitate defense preparation and judicial rulings [e.g., paragraph 30 in ""Commission v Ireland""]. In ""Commission of the European Communities v Département du Loiret and Scott SA"", the issue centers on the adequacy of reasoning under Article 253 EC, ensuring that measures disclose clear reasoning for affected parties and judicial oversight [paragraph 43]. Finally, in ""Z v European Parliament"", the issue is the precision required in appeals under Article 51 of the EC Statute and Article 112(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure [paragraph 33].

#### d) Description of Relevant Legal Rules
The relevant legal rules include Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, which mandates that applications must clearly and precisely state the subject matter and pleas in law, as highlighted in cases like ""Commission v Ireland"" and ""Commission v Finland"". Article 253 EC (now Article 296 TFEU) requires that EU acts provide appropriate reasoning, tailored to the context and nature of the measure, as discussed in ""Commission v Département du Loiret and Scott SA"" [paragraph 43]. Additionally, Article 51 of the EC Statute and Article 112(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure, relevant in ""Z v European Parliament"", stipulate that appeals must precisely indicate contested elements and supporting legal arguments [paragraph 33]. These provisions collectively ensure transparency, fairness, and effective judicial review in EU legal proceedings.

#### e) Arguments of the Parties and Analysis by the Court of Justice
While specific arguments of the parties are not detailed in the context, the CJEU’s analysis focuses on established case-law to assess compliance with procedural and substantive requirements. In ""Commission v Frédéric Daffix"", the Court examines whether the statement of reasons in the contested decision meets the standards set by prior rulings, ensuring the affected party can understand the basis of the decision and the Court can review its legality [paragraphs 35-46]. In cases like ""Commission v Ireland"" and ""Commission v Finland"", the Court analyzes whether applications meet the clarity and precision required under Article 38(1)(c), emphasizing the need for coherent presentation of facts and law to avoid rulings beyond the scope or missing key complaints [e.g., paragraph 30 in ""Commission v Ireland""]. In ""Commission v Département du Loiret and Scott SA"", the Court evaluates the reasoning of the measure against Article 253 EC, considering the context and interests of affected parties [paragraph 43]. In ""Z v European Parliament"", the Court stresses the necessity of precise identification of contested issues in appeals [paragraph 33].

#### f) Conclusions by the Court of Justice
The CJEU’s conclusions reinforce the importance of procedural and substantive compliance. In ""Commission v Frédéric Daffix"", the Court likely concluded on the adequacy of the statement of reasons based on its detailed review [paragraphs 35-46]. In the procedural cases involving Article 38(1)(c), such as ""Commission v Ireland"" and ""Commission v Finland"", the Court consistently upholds the need for clear and precise applications to ensure fair proceedings and effective judicial review [e.g., paragraph 30 in ""Commission v Ireland""]. In ""Commission v Département du Loiret and Scott SA"", the Court affirms that reasoning must be clear and contextually appropriate under Article 253 EC [paragraph 43]. Finally, in ""Z v European Parliament"", the Court concludes that appeals must meet strict precision standards to be admissible [paragraph 33].

### 2. Importance of These Cases in the General Scheme of EU Law

The cases discussed above hold significant importance in the framework of EU law, particularly in the realms of procedural and substantive legal principles that underpin the functioning of the EU judicial system. They collectively emphasize the CJEU’s role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and fairness in legal proceedings involving EU institutions, Member States, and individuals.

From a procedural law perspective, cases like ""Commission v Ireland"", ""Commission v Finland"", and ""Commission v Italian Republic"" highlight the critical nature of Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure. This provision ensures that legal applications are clear and precise, enabling defendants to prepare adequately and preventing the Court from overstepping or missing key issues [e.g., paragraph 30 in ""Commission v Ireland""]. This procedural rigor is essential for maintaining the integrity of judicial processes within the EU, ensuring that all parties have a fair opportunity to present their case and that the Court can deliver well-informed rulings. Similarly, ""Z v European Parliament"" underscores the importance of precision in appeals under Article 51 of the EC Statute, reinforcing the procedural discipline required at every stage of litigation [paragraph 33].

On the substantive side, ""Commission v Frédéric Daffix"" and ""Commission v Département du Loiret and Scott SA"" address the fundamental principle of reasoned decision-making under Article 253 EC. The requirement for clear and unequivocal reasoning, as analyzed in these cases, is a cornerstone of EU administrative law, ensuring that decisions affecting individuals or entities are transparent and subject to effective judicial review [e.g., paragraph 43 in ""Commission v Département du Loiret and Scott SA""]. This principle not only protects the rights of those affected but also upholds the rule of law by holding EU institutions accountable for their actions.

Reflecting on broader themes in EU law, these cases collectively contribute to the development of a coherent legal order where procedural fairness and substantive transparency are interlinked. They align with the EU’s commitment to the principles of legality and due process, ensuring that both the form and content of legal actions are subject to scrutiny. Moreover, they demonstrate the CJEU’s role as a guardian of EU law, consistently applying and refining legal standards through its case-law to address evolving challenges in the Union’s legal landscape. These judgments serve as precedents that guide future cases, reinforcing the predictability and stability of EU legal processes, which are vital for fostering trust among Member States, institutions, and citizens.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","**a) Difference between Absolute and Relative Rights with Examples from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights**

In the context of EU law, absolute rights are those fundamental rights that cannot be restricted or limited under any circumstances, as they are considered inviolable. These rights must be respected without exception, regardless of public interest or other competing considerations. An example of an absolute right from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is the right to human dignity, enshrined in Article 1, which is non-derogable and must be upheld in all situations as a core principle of human rights protection. On the other hand, relative rights are fundamental rights that can be limited or restricted under specific conditions, such as for reasons of public security, public health, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, provided that such limitations are proportionate and necessary. An example of a relative right from the Charter is the right to freedom of expression under Article 11, which may be subject to restrictions to protect public order or the rights of others, as long as these restrictions comply with the principles of necessity and proportionality.

**b) Reasons for the CJEU's Shift in Acknowledging Fundamental Rights in 'Internationale Handelsgesellschaft'**

In the landmark case of 'Internationale Handelsgesellschaft', the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) declared that respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the Court, while drawing inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, but ensuring such protection within the framework of Community law. This marked a significant shift from the Court's earlier hesitation to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from Member States' constitutional laws. One key reason for this development was the need to ensure the supremacy and uniform application of EU law across Member States. By integrating fundamental rights into the general principles of EU law, the CJEU aimed to prevent national courts from challenging EU law on the basis of national constitutional rights, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the EU legal order. A second reason was the growing recognition of the importance of fundamental rights as a legitimizing factor for the EU's authority. As the EU's powers expanded, there was increasing pressure to align Community law with the values and traditions of Member States, ensuring that the EU legal system was perceived as respecting human rights, thus enhancing its legitimacy and acceptance among Member States and their citizens.

**c) Three Principal Sources of EU Fundamental Rights and Their Treaty Basis**

The three principal sources, often referred to as the ""bill of rights,"" for EU fundamental rights are consistently highlighted in the case law of the CJEU. First, fundamental rights are drawn from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as emphasized in cases such as 'Liselotte Hauer v Land Rheinland-Pfalz', 'European Parliament v Council of the European Union', and others, where the Court underscores its role in ensuring the observance of these rights as part of the general principles of law. Second, international treaties for the protection of human rights on which Member States have collaborated or are signatories serve as guidelines, with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) holding special significance, as noted in cases like 'Bernard Connolly v Commission of the European Communities' and 'Yassin Abdullah Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council of the European Union and Commission of the European Communities'. Third, the general principles of law, of which fundamental rights form an integral part, are a key source, as reiterated across multiple judgments including 'Dieter Krombach v André Bamberski' and 'Eugen Schmidberger, Internationale Transporte und Planzüge v Republik Österreich'. These sources are not explicitly stated in a single treaty provision within the provided context, but their recognition is embedded in the CJEU's case law, which collectively forms the foundation for fundamental rights protection within the EU legal framework, ensuring alignment with both national and international human rights standards.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","In addressing Maria's situation, a Portuguese woman residing in Italy who faces a refusal to renew her residence permit on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation due to working only 15 hours a week, we must consider the principles of EU law concerning the free movement of persons, particularly under Article 39 EC (now Article 45 TFEU), and relevant case law.

**A) Is the decision by the Italian authorities in conformity with EU law?**

The decision by the Italian authorities to refuse Maria's residence permit on the basis that her 15-hour workweek does not qualify her as a privileged 'EU worker' may not be in conformity with EU law. Under Article 39 EC, freedom of movement for workers entails the abolition of discrimination based on nationality regarding employment and conditions of work, as highlighted in ""Andrea Raccanelli v Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften eV."" Furthermore, the definition of a 'worker' under EU law, as clarified in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Denmark,"" includes any person who performs services for another under direction and receives remuneration, provided the activities are real and genuine and not merely marginal or ancillary, as established in cases like ""Lawrie-Blum"" and ""Collins."" Maria's part-time employment of 15 hours a week as a science teacher likely constitutes real and genuine activity, given her previous full-time role in the same field, and should not be dismissed as marginal. Therefore, the Italian authorities' decision to deny her status as an EU worker appears inconsistent with the broad interpretation of 'worker' under EU law, which aims to facilitate free movement.

Additionally, EU law protects workers from being deterred from exercising their right to free movement due to disadvantageous working conditions or residency requirements, as noted in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Denmark"" with reference to ""Ledoux."" Imposing a strict requirement of full-time employment or a minimum number of working hours could be seen as an obstacle to Maria's freedom of movement, further suggesting that the Italian decision may contravene EU principles.

**B) Does Maria have any other option beyond being an 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy?**

Beyond qualifying as an EU worker, Maria may have alternative grounds to reside in Italy under EU law. As a national of a Member State, her right of residence is generally tied to being a worker or a job seeker, as discussed in ""Georgios Orfanopoulos and Others and Raffaele Oliveri v Land Baden-Württemberg"" with reference to ""Antonissen."" However, she might also derive a right of residence from other provisions of Community law, such as those related to family reunification or other specific circumstances, if applicable, as hinted at in the same case. While the provided context does not elaborate on her personal situation (e.g., family ties or financial means), EU law under instruments like the Citizenship Directive (Directive 2004/38/EC, though not directly mentioned in the context) often allows EU citizens to reside in another Member State if they have sufficient resources and health insurance, even without being employed. Maria could explore such provisions to assert her right to stay in Italy, provided she meets the relevant criteria. Additionally, any national rules imposing residency conditions that hinder the freedom to provide services or work, as seen in ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic,"" could be challenged if they disproportionately restrict her rights as an EU citizen.

In conclusion, the Italian authorities’ refusal to recognize Maria as an EU worker due to her part-time employment likely does not align with EU law’s broad definition of a worker and the principles of free movement. Moreover, she may have alternative avenues to secure her residence in Italy under other EU legal provisions, depending on her circumstances.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,

Presentation of the Decision in ""Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA""

**a) Summary of Relevant Facts**  
The case of ""Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA"" involves a dispute between Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA, two entities likely representing a consortium and a service provider, and Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA, which is presumably the Italian railway infrastructure manager. While specific details of the factual background are not provided in the given context, the dispute appears to center on issues related to the application or interpretation of EU law in a contractual or regulatory framework concerning railway services or infrastructure management. The disagreement likely pertains to obligations or rights under EU law, prompting the need for judicial clarification.

**b) Procedures in Courts and Reasons**  
The case reached the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) through a preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU (formerly Article 234 EC), a mechanism highlighted in cases such as ""Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA"" and ""Grundig Italiana SpA v Ministero delle Finanze."" This procedure allows national courts to refer questions on the interpretation of EU law to the CJEU to ensure uniform application across Member States. The national court, before which the dispute was initially brought, sought guidance from the CJEU to resolve uncertainties in EU law relevant to the case, as it is solely the national court’s responsibility to determine the need for such a ruling based on the specific circumstances, a principle consistently upheld in prior case law like ""Ministero dell'Industria, del Commercio e dell'Artigianato v Lucchini SpA.""

**c) Central Legal Issue(s) Discussed by the Court of Justice**  
The central legal issues in this case likely revolve around the interpretation of specific provisions of EU law pertinent to railway services or public procurement, though exact details are not specified in the context. Drawing from the procedural framework in cases like ""Teresa Cicala v Regione Siciliana,"" the CJEU would have been tasked with providing clarity on the meaning or application of EU legal rules to assist the national court in delivering its judgment. The Court’s role, as established in prior rulings, is to interpret EU law rather than assess the facts, which remain within the national court’s purview.

**d) Description of Relevant Legal Rules (Provisions of EU Law)**  
The relevant legal rules in this case would fall under the framework of EU law, particularly those related to the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU, as emphasized in multiple cases such as ""Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA."" This provision ensures cooperation between national courts and the CJEU, obliging the Court to provide rulings on questions of EU law interpretation when requested by national courts. Additionally, principles of transparency and reasoning, as seen in ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities"" and ""Italian Republic v Council of the European Union,"" under Articles 253 EC and 190 of the Treaty, may be relevant if the case involves challenges to institutional acts or decisions requiring clear justification.

**e) Parties’ Arguments and Court of Justice’s Analysis**  
While specific arguments of the parties are not detailed in the provided context, it can be inferred from the procedural nature of preliminary rulings, as discussed in ""Grundig Italiana SpA v Ministero delle Finanze,"" that the parties would have presented differing interpretations of the applicable EU law provisions. The national court would have submitted specific questions to the CJEU for clarification. The CJEU, adhering to its role as outlined in ""Ministero dell'Industria, del Commercio e dell'Artigianato v Lucchini SpA,"" would have analyzed these questions strictly within the scope of EU law interpretation, avoiding any factual assessment. The Court’s analysis would focus on ensuring a uniform application of EU law, drawing on settled case law to provide a coherent legal framework for the national court to apply.

**f) Conclusion Regarding the Issue(s)**  
The CJEU’s conclusion in ""Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA"" would have been to provide a ruling on the interpretation of the relevant EU law provisions, guiding the national court in resolving the dispute. As established in prior cases like ""Teresa Cicala v Regione Siciliana,"" the Court is generally bound to give a ruling when questions concern EU law interpretation, ensuring that the national court can proceed with its judgment based on a clear understanding of EU legal principles. The exact outcome or specific interpretation provided by the Court is not detailed in the context, but the decision would align with the CJEU’s mandate to uphold the uniform application of EU law.

### 2. Legal Analysis: Importance of the Case in the General Scheme of EU Law

The case of ""Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA"" holds significance within the broader framework of EU law, particularly in the context of procedural and substantive legal principles that ensure the uniform application of EU rules across Member States. Procedurally, this case underscores the critical role of the preliminary ruling mechanism under Article 267 TFEU, a cornerstone of EU judicial cooperation as highlighted in cases like ""Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA"" and ""Grundig Italiana SpA v Ministero delle Finanze."" This mechanism allows national courts to seek guidance from the CJEU, ensuring that EU law is interpreted consistently, thereby preventing divergent national applications that could undermine the internal market or other EU objectives. The importance of this case lies in reinforcing the division of responsibilities between national courts, which handle factual assessments, and the CJEU, which focuses on legal interpretation, as reiterated in ""Ministero dell'Industria, del Commercio e dell'Artigianato v Lucchini SpA.""

Substantively, while the specific area of EU law addressed in this case is not detailed, it likely contributes to the body of law concerning sectors such as transport or public procurement, given the involvement of a railway infrastructure entity. The CJEU’s rulings in such areas often shape national policies and practices, ensuring compliance with EU directives or regulations. This case also reflects the broader principle of transparency and reasoned decision-making, a recurring theme in EU law as seen in ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities"" and ""Italian Republic v Council of the European Union."" If the dispute involved a challenge to an institutional act, the requirement for clear reasoning under Articles 253 EC or 190 of the Treaty would be pivotal, enabling effective judicial review and protecting the rights of the parties involved.

Furthermore, the case illustrates the CJEU’s appellate oversight role, as discussed in ""European Parliament v Carlo Ripa di Meana, Leoluca Orlando and Gastone Parigi,"" where the Court of Justice reviews legal classifications and inferences drawn by lower courts or institutions. This ensures that legal interpretations remain consistent with EU objectives, safeguarding the rule of law within the Union. Reflecting on related topics, this case also connects to the principle of effective judicial protection, ensuring that national courts can rely on the CJEU for authoritative guidance, thereby upholding access to justice for individuals and entities across the EU. In conclusion, ""Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA"" contributes to the cohesive functioning of the EU legal order by reinforcing procedural cooperation, substantive legal clarity, and the uniform application of EU law, aligning with the foundational principles we have studied.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"To address the EU law terms and concepts requested, I will draw upon the context provided and relevant legal principles.

a) **Indirect challenge of an EU act**: An indirect challenge of an EU act occurs when a national court questions the validity of an EU act in the context of a dispute before it. This typically happens when a national court refers a question to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 TFEU. The national court does not directly annul the EU act but seeks clarification on its validity, which can lead to the CJEU declaring the act invalid if it finds it contrary to EU law. This mechanism ensures that EU law is uniformly interpreted and applied across Member States.

b) **National procedural autonomy**: This concept refers to the discretion that Member States have in determining the procedural rules governing the application of EU law within their legal systems. While Member States must ensure that their procedures do not make it impossible or excessively difficult to exercise rights conferred by EU law, they retain the autonomy to design their own procedural frameworks. This principle is balanced against the need to protect the effectiveness of EU law, as seen in cases like ""Commission v Greece,"" where the effectiveness of the Treaty in the field of freedom of establishment must not be frustrated by unilateral national provisions.

c) **The principle of supremacy**: The principle of supremacy holds that EU law takes precedence over conflicting national law. This ensures uniform application and effectiveness of EU law across all Member States. The principle is fundamental to the functioning of the EU legal order, as it prevents national laws from undermining EU objectives and rights. The supremacy of EU law is a cornerstone of the EU legal system, ensuring that EU treaties and legislation are uniformly applied and respected by Member States.

d) **Non-legislative EU act**: Non-legislative EU acts are measures adopted by EU institutions that do not have the same general applicability as legislative acts. These include delegated acts and implementing acts. Delegated acts allow the European Commission to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of legislative acts, while implementing acts ensure uniform application of EU law across Member States. The context provided in ""Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union"" highlights that implementation includes both the drawing-up of rules and their application to specific cases.

e) **Field of application of EU fundamental rights**: EU fundamental rights apply within the scope of EU law, meaning they are binding on EU institutions and Member States when they are implementing EU law. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union outlines these rights, and their application is determined by the extent to which EU law is relevant to a particular situation. The principle of proportionality, as discussed in ""Commission v Italian Republic,"" ensures that any national legislation addressing essential interests or overriding requirements must conform to EU fundamental rights standards.

These concepts are integral to understanding the interplay between EU law and national legal systems, ensuring that EU objectives are effectively pursued while respecting Member States' procedural autonomy.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","In the dispute between Happy Times and Big Fun regarding the sale of the 'Bang' toy gun in Sweden, the central issue is whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive despite Sweden's failure to implement it. The Safe Toys Directive is a maximum harmonization act, meaning it sets uniform standards across the EU for the production, marketing, and sale of toys, aiming to reduce barriers to trade within the internal market. The directive allows for the prohibition of toys only when they are ""obviously dangerous in normal use,"" which is a narrower criterion than the Swedish law prohibiting toys imitating firearms.

The case of ""Boehringer Ingelheim KG, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG, Glaxo Group Ltd, The Wellcome Foundation Ltd, SmithKline Beecham plc, Beecham Group plc, SmithKline & French Laboratories Ltd and Eli Lilly and Co. v Swingward Ltd and Dowelhurst Ltd"" is relevant here. It highlights that a trade mark proprietor's opposition to repackaging cannot be accepted if it constitutes a disguised restriction on trade between Member States. This principle can be extended to argue that national measures that are more restrictive than EU directives may constitute barriers to trade, especially when the directive is intended to harmonize standards across the EU.

Furthermore, the case of ""Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG v Centrafarm Vertriebsgesellschaft Pharmazeutischer Erzeugnisse mbH"" discusses whether the exercise of certain rights, such as trade mark rights, can be considered a disguised restriction on trade. Similarly, Sweden's stricter national law could be seen as a disguised restriction on the free movement of goods, particularly since the Safe Toys Directive aims to limit such prohibitions to cases where toys are ""obviously dangerous in normal use.""

The principle from ""Criminal proceedings against Gunnar Nilsson, Per Olov Hagelgren and Solweig Arrborn"" also supports the argument that national rules applying without distinction to products from other Member States do not fall within the scope of Article 30 of the Treaty. However, Sweden's specific prohibition on toys imitating firearms does distinguish based on the product's characteristics, potentially affecting the marketing of products from other Member States differently from domestic products.

Given that the Safe Toys Directive is a maximum harmonization directive, its provisions should take precedence over conflicting national laws. The failure of Sweden to implement the directive does not negate its applicability, as established in ""The Queen, on the application of: Swedish Match AB and Swedish Match UK Ltd v Secretary of State for Health,"" where the Court held that Member States must comply with EU directives even if they have not been implemented, provided the directive is clear, precise, and unconditional.

In conclusion, Big Fun can argue that the Safe Toys Directive preempts the stricter Swedish national law, and that the sale of the 'Bang' toy should be permitted under the directive's provisions. The directive's aim to harmonize toy safety standards across the EU supports the argument that Sweden's failure to implement the directive should not allow it to enforce a more restrictive national prohibition. Therefore, Big Fun may rely on the Safe Toys Directive to contest the claim that it is violating Swedish law.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","### a) Special Legislative Procedure

The special legislative procedure in the EU refers to a legislative process where the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union share legislative powers, but the Council has a more dominant role. This procedure is typically used for sensitive areas such as taxation, social security, and certain aspects of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The legal basis for this procedure is determined by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which outlines specific areas where the special legislative procedure applies. The European Parliament v Council of the European Union cases, such as C‑130/10 and C‑658/11, emphasize that the legal basis of a measure determines the procedure to be followed, highlighting the importance of correctly identifying the legal basis to ensure the appropriate legislative process is applied.

### b) Measures Having Equivalent Effect to Quantitative Restrictions (MEQRs)

MEQRs are national measures that, while not outright quantitative restrictions, have the same effect by hindering intra-Community trade. Article 28 EC (now Article 34 TFEU) prohibits such measures. The landmark case of Case 8/74 Dassonville established that any national measure capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, intra-Community trade falls under this prohibition. This principle was further reinforced in cases like Commission v Netherlands and Commission v Germany, which clarified that both direct and indirect measures that potentially affect trade are covered. However, MEQRs can be justified on grounds of public interest or imperative requirements, provided they are appropriate and necessary, as seen in Commission v Italy and Commission v Finland.

### c) Concerted Practices

Concerted practices refer to a form of coordination between companies that, without being an outright agreement, knowingly substitutes practical cooperation between them for the risks of competition. This concept is primarily addressed in competition law under Article 101 TFEU, which prohibits agreements and concerted practices that may affect trade between Member States and prevent or restrict competition. The European Court of Justice has consistently held that such practices are illegal if they distort competition, as they undermine the competitive market structure intended by EU law.

### d) Enforcement Actions/Infringement Proceedings

Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are legal actions initiated by the European Commission against Member States that fail to fulfill their obligations under EU law. These proceedings are governed by Article 258 TFEU. The Commission investigates and, if necessary, brings a case before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to ensure compliance. The process involves several stages, including a formal notice, a reasoned opinion, and potentially a referral to the CJEU. The Commission's role in these proceedings is crucial for maintaining the uniform application and effectiveness of EU law across Member States.

### e) Proportionality

The principle of proportionality is a fundamental legal principle in EU law, requiring that measures taken by EU institutions or Member States do not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. This principle is applied to ensure that actions are appropriate and necessary for attaining legitimate objectives. In the context of justifying MEQRs, the principle of proportionality is crucial, as seen in cases like Joined Cases C‑388/00 and C‑429/00 Radiosistemi, where the Court assessed whether national measures were appropriate and did not go beyond what was necessary to achieve their objectives. This principle ensures a balance between the aims pursued and the means employed, safeguarding individual rights and freedoms.","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law.","In addressing the hypothetical scenario involving Cynthia, we need to consider several aspects of EU law concerning her rights as an EU citizen residing in Belgium.

a) **Modification in Employment Situation and EU Worker Status:**

Under EU law, specifically the principles established in cases like *Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon*, the concept of an ""EU worker"" is central to determining rights to residence. The Court has held that once a worker is admitted into the public service of a Member State, they are entitled to the protections under Articles 39(1) to (3) EC, which cover the free movement of workers. However, the reduction in Cynthia's working hours from full-time to part-time could potentially affect her status as an ""EU worker."" The Court has generally required that the work be genuine and effective, which typically implies a certain level of engagement and remuneration. If her part-time work is deemed insufficient to meet these criteria, it might be argued that she no longer qualifies as an EU worker. However, this determination would depend on specific facts, such as the nature and remuneration of her part-time work, which are not detailed here.

b) **Rejection from Ministry Job Due to Nationality:**

The rejection of Cynthia's application for a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media on the grounds of her not being a Belgian citizen raises issues of discrimination based on nationality. According to *Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium*, restrictions that discriminate against nationals of other Member States are prohibited under Article 7 of the Treaty. Public service positions that require a special relationship of allegiance to the State, as noted in *Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon*, may be exceptions. However, such exceptions must be justified and proportionate. If the position does not genuinely require such a special relationship, the rejection could be seen as discriminatory under EU law.

c) **Rejection from Private Academy Job Due to Nationality and Language Requirements:**

Regarding the rejection from the private academy, the situation involves both nationality and language requirements. The principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, as established in *Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium*, would apply here. The requirement for an advanced level of other EU languages, while potentially justifiable for practical reasons, must not serve as a pretext for discrimination. If the language requirement is genuinely necessary for the job and applied equally to all candidates, it might be permissible. However, if it disproportionately affects non-Belgian nationals without a legitimate justification, it could be considered discriminatory.

In summary, Cynthia's situation involves complex interactions between her rights as an EU citizen and the specific requirements of employment in Belgium. The key legal principles involve the free movement of workers, non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, and the justification for any exceptions to these principles.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","In resolving the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough, the primary EU law-related issue revolves around the interaction between national legislation and EU directives, specifically the Safe Building Directive and the 1948 Law on Public Safety in Fantasia.

### Applicability of the Safe Building Directive

The Safe Building Directive, adopted by the EU in 2015, aims to harmonize building standards across Member States to facilitate trade in construction work within the internal market. Article 20 of the Directive explicitly states that Member States may not introduce further requirements on construction work and good building practices beyond what is laid down in Articles 5-15. Since Article 5-15 does not mention shelters, the Directive precludes Member States from imposing additional requirements, such as those found in paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety.

### Implementation and Effectiveness

Fantasia implemented the Safe Building Directive through the 2016 Construction Act, which incorporated Articles 5-15 verbatim. The Directive entered into force on June 1, 2015, and Fantasia complied by June 1, 2016, well before the deadline of December 31, 2016. The 2016 Construction Act reflects the harmonized standards set by the Directive, indicating that Fantasia intended to align its national legislation with EU law.

### Legal Certainty and Good Faith

The principle of legal certainty, as discussed in cases like ""Belgische Staat v Cobelfret NV,"" suggests that legal relationships established in good faith should not be easily disrupted. However, this principle does not override the supremacy of EU law. In this context, the Directive's provisions take precedence over conflicting national laws, provided the Directive has been correctly implemented and is directly applicable.

### Interpretation and Precedent

The settled case-law, as seen in cases like ""Kingdom of Spain v Commission of the European Communities,"" emphasizes the importance of Member States being closely involved in the decision-making process and being aware of the reasons behind EU decisions. While this case-law primarily addresses the adequacy of reasons in decisions on the clearance of accounts, it underscores the broader principle that EU law must be clear and accessible to Member States.

### Resolution

Given the supremacy of EU law, the Safe Building Directive's Article 20 precludes the application of paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety in this context. The Directive's aim to harmonize building standards means that any national requirement imposing additional obligations, such as the construction of a shelter, is incompatible with EU law. Therefore, Good Enough's argument that paragraph 138 should be set aside is valid.

### Conclusion

As a judge, I would rule in favor of Good Enough, finding that the Safe Building Directive preempts the conflicting national requirement. The Directive's clear prohibition on additional requirements beyond Articles 5-15 means that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety cannot be enforced in this case. This decision aligns with the principles of EU law supremacy and harmonization, ensuring that national legislation does not undermine the objectives of EU directives.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","a) **The Ordinary Legislative Procedure (OLP):** The Ordinary Legislative Procedure, formerly known as the co-decision procedure, is the main legislative process by which directives and regulations are adopted in the European Union. It involves the joint adoption of legislation by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The legal basis for this procedure is determined by the specific provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which outlines the areas where the OLP applies. The legal basis of a measure determines the procedure to be followed in adopting that measure, as established in cases such as ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"" (C‑130/10 and C‑658/11). This ensures that the legislative process is consistent with the objectives laid down by the Treaty.

b) **State Liability:** State liability refers to the principle that Member States can be held liable for damages caused to individuals due to breaches of EU law. This principle was developed by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in cases such as ""Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland"" and ""The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others."" The Court has established that liability for legislative measures takes into account the complexity of the situations, difficulties in application or interpretation, and the margin of discretion available to the author of the act. This ensures that individuals can seek compensation when their rights under EU law are infringed by Member States.

c) **The Preliminary Ruling Procedure:** The preliminary ruling procedure allows national courts to refer questions to the CJEU regarding the interpretation or validity of EU law. This procedure ensures uniform application and interpretation of EU law across Member States. The CJEU's jurisdiction in this context is less extensive under certain Titles of the Treaty on European Union, as noted in ""Gestoras Pro Amnistía, Juan Mari Olano Olano and Julen Zelarain Errasti v Council of the European Union."" This procedure is crucial for resolving disputes and clarifying EU law, thereby maintaining legal certainty and coherence within the EU legal order.

d) **Indirect Effect:** The principle of indirect effect requires national courts to interpret national law as far as possible in light of the wording and purpose of EU law. This principle ensures that EU law is effectively applied even when direct effect is not possible. The principle of indirect effect is part of the broader framework of ensuring that EU law takes precedence and is uniformly applied across Member States, supporting the effectiveness of EU law in areas such as freedom of establishment, as seen in ""European Commission v Republic of Austria.""

e) **Subsidiarity:** The principle of subsidiarity is a guiding principle in EU law that determines the level at which decisions are made. It holds that the EU should only act when objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone and can be better achieved at the EU level. This principle is designed to ensure that decisions are made as closely as possible to the citizens and that the EU does not take action unless it is more effective than action taken at the national or local level. The principle of subsidiarity is reflected in the Treaty provisions and is intended to fill gaps where no specific Treaty provisions confer express or implied powers to act, as discussed in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"" (Opinion 2/94 and Joined Cases C‑402/05 P and C‑415/05 P).","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,
"Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B. Juan is Spanish and lives in Madrid with his Argentine wife Carmen. The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not? (Reason as with A(i) above), yet use question B facts.) ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation? (Include whether it can bring a court proceeding against Portugal.) Your assignment: Answer each sub-question from a EU law perspective. Support your answers by referring at every opportunity during your answers when relevant references are made of sources of EU law. Make clear which sub-question you are answering. Where appropriate provide specific examples (like in math class), not simply an unexplained answer. In other words describe several steps applying the law you have learned to these facts and demonstrating your understanding of how they fit within the broader context of the EU legal system functions.","### Scenario A

#### i) Conformity of the Italian Public School's Decision with EU Law

The decision by the Italian company to deny Anna employment based on her non-Italian citizenship appears to conflict with EU law, specifically the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality. According to the case ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic,"" measures that draw distinctions based on residence or nationality can be discriminatory if they primarily disadvantage nationals of other Member States (see Case C-224/97 *Ciola*). The principle of non-discrimination is enshrined in Article 18 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which prohibits any discrimination on grounds of nationality within the scope of application of the Treaties.

In this context, the Italian company's requirement for Italian citizenship as a condition for employment could be seen as a measure that operates mainly to the detriment of nationals from other Member States, such as Anna. The case law, including *Angonese* (Case C-281/98), establishes that a measure is discriminatory if it disadvantages nationals of other Member States, even if it also affects nationals of the host state. Therefore, unless the Italian company can justify this requirement by demonstrating a legitimate public interest that is not already safeguarded by the rules applicable in Sweden (Anna's home state), the decision is likely not in conformity with EU law.

#### ii) Remedies Available to Anna

Anna may have several remedies available to her. She can bring court proceedings against the decision in Italy, as the alleged discrimination occurred there. Under EU law, individuals can challenge discriminatory practices before national courts, which are required to interpret national law in conformity with EU law (see Case C-435/99 *Commission v Portugal*). If the national court is unable to provide adequate relief, Anna may ultimately bring the case before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of EU law.

### Scenario B

#### i) Conformity of the Portuguese Authority's Decision with EU Law

The decision by Portuguese authorities to deny Carmen a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen appears to conflict with EU law. According to the case ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Spain,"" the right of entry and residence for third-country nationals who are spouses of EU citizens is derived from the family relationship alone. This means that such individuals should be granted a residence permit as a measure to prove their individual position under EU law, rather than as a measure conferring rights (see MRAX, paragraph 74).

The relevant legal framework is provided by Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. This directive grants the right of residence to third-country nationals who are family members of EU citizens, provided certain conditions are met. Therefore, the Portuguese authority's decision is likely not in conformity with EU law, as it fails to recognize Carmen's right to reside in Portugal based on her marriage to Juan, an EU citizen.

#### ii) Remedies at EU Level

If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits in such cases, the European Commission has the authority to initiate infringement proceedings against Portugal under Article 258 TFEU. The Commission can bring a case before the CJEU if it determines that a Member State has failed to fulfill its obligations under EU law. This process involves the Commission issuing a reasoned opinion, followed by a referral to the CJEU if the Member State does not comply.

Additionally, Juan and Carmen could challenge the decision in Portuguese courts, which may refer the case to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Directive 2004/38/EC. This would help ensure that national authorities apply EU law correctly and consistently across Member States.","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","1) The duty of Member States to fulfill their obligations under EU law is rooted in Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). This article establishes the principle of sincere cooperation, which obliges Member States to take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfillment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union.

2) If the European Union suspects that Italy is breaching Union law, it can initiate infringement proceedings against Italy. This process begins with the European Commission sending a formal letter of notice to Italy, outlining the alleged breach and requesting information or action to remedy the situation. If Italy does not respond satisfactorily, the Commission may issue a reasoned opinion, which is a formal request to comply with EU law. Should Italy still fail to comply, the Commission can refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The CJEU can then rule on the matter, and if it finds that Italy has indeed breached EU law, it can impose penalties, including financial sanctions.

3) If the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfill an obligation under the Treaties and Italy does not comply with the judgment, the Commission can bring Italy back before the Court. The CJEU has the authority to impose financial penalties on Member States that fail to comply with its judgments. These penalties can include a lump sum and/or a daily penalty payment until compliance is achieved. This mechanism ensures that Member States adhere to their obligations under EU law, maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of the Union's legal framework.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,

#### 1. Summary of Relevant Facts

In the case of ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix,"" the dispute centered around the adequacy of the statement of reasons provided by a contested decision. The Commission of the European Communities, acting as the applicant, challenged the decision on the grounds that it did not sufficiently explain the reasoning behind the decision, thereby impeding the ability of the person concerned to understand the basis of the decision and the Court's ability to review its legality.

#### 2. Procedures in Courts

The case was brought before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The Court examined whether the contested decision met the requirement for a proper statement of reasons as mandated by EU law. This procedural requirement ensures that decisions adversely affecting individuals are transparent and justifiable.

#### 3. Central Legal Issues

The central legal issue discussed by the Court was whether the contested decision provided a sufficient statement of reasons. The Court considered established case-law, which emphasizes that a decision must disclose the reasoning in a clear and unequivocal manner, enabling both the affected party and the Court to understand and review the decision's foundation.

#### 4. Relevant Legal Rules

The relevant legal rule is derived from Article 253 of the EC Treaty, which requires that decisions adversely affecting individuals must state the reasons on which they are based. This requirement is intended to ensure transparency and accountability in decision-making processes.

#### 5. Arguments and Analysis

The Commission argued that the decision lacked a proper statement of reasons, which is essential for legal scrutiny and understanding. The Court analyzed this claim by referencing previous case-law, such as ""Case 195/80 Michel v Parliament"" and ""Case T-1/90 Pérez-Mínguez Casariego v Commission,"" which underscore the necessity for decisions to provide sufficient details for legal review.

The Court concluded that the statement of reasons must be appropriate to the act in question and must clearly disclose the reasoning followed by the institution that adopted the measure. This ensures that the persons concerned can ascertain the reasons for the measure and that the Court can exercise its power of review effectively.

### Importance of the Case in EU Law

This case is significant in the general scheme of EU law as it reinforces the principle of transparency and accountability in administrative decision-making. It underscores the importance of providing a clear and detailed statement of reasons in decisions that affect individuals, ensuring that such decisions are subject to effective judicial review.

The case highlights the procedural safeguards embedded in EU law, which protect individuals' rights by ensuring that they are informed of the reasons behind decisions that impact them. This aligns with the broader principles of good administration and the rule of law within the EU legal framework.

Furthermore, the case contributes to the body of case-law that defines the standards for administrative decisions, emphasizing the need for clarity and precision in the reasoning provided. This is crucial for maintaining trust in EU institutions and ensuring that their actions are legally sound and justifiable.

Overall, ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"" serves as a reminder of the essential role of procedural fairness in EU law, reinforcing the requirement for institutions to act transparently and accountably.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","a) In the context of fundamental rights, an absolute right is one that is not subject to any limitations or restrictions, whereas a relative right can be limited under certain conditions, typically to balance it against other rights or public interests. Within the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, an example of an absolute right is the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as outlined in Article 4. This right is considered non-derogable and must be upheld without exception. On the other hand, an example of a relative right is the right to respect for private and family life, home, and communications (Article 7). This right can be restricted under specific conditions, such as for the protection of national security, public safety, or the economic well-being of the country, provided that such restrictions are necessary and proportionate.

b) In the case of Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) emphasized that respect for fundamental rights is an integral part of the general principles of EU law. This marked a significant development for several reasons. Firstly, the CJEU sought to ensure that EU law was compatible with the fundamental rights recognized by the constitutional traditions of the Member States, thereby fostering legitimacy and acceptance of EU law among Member States. Secondly, by acknowledging these rights, the Court aimed to provide a robust framework for the protection of individual rights within the EU legal order, ensuring that EU institutions and Member States respect fundamental rights when implementing EU law. This approach helped to bridge the gap between EU law and national constitutional traditions, reinforcing the rule of law within the EU.

c) The three principal sources of EU fundamental rights, often referred to as the ""bill of rights,"" are:

1. The constitutional traditions common to the Member States, which provide a foundation for the general principles of EU law, as recognized in cases such as Liselotte Hauer v Land Rheinland-Pfalz and Bernard Connolly v Commission of the European Communities.

2. The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), which has special significance as a guideline for EU fundamental rights, as highlighted in cases like European Parliament v Council of the European Union and Dieter Krombach v André Bamberski.

3. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was proclaimed in 2000 and became legally binding with the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009. The Charter consolidates and articulates the fundamental rights applicable within the EU legal order.

These sources are reflected in the treaties, particularly in the Treaty on European Union (TEU), which, in Article 6(3), states that the EU shall accede to the ECHR, and in Article 6(1), recognizes the Charter of Fundamental Rights as having the same legal value as the Treaties.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","In assessing whether the decision by Italian authorities to refuse Maria's residence renewal is in conformity with EU law, we must consider the principles of free movement for workers within the European Union, as outlined in Article 39 EC (now Article 45 TFEU). This article ensures the abolition of discrimination based on nationality concerning employment, remuneration, and other conditions of work and employment, as established in ""Commission v Greece.""

Firstly, the definition of a ""worker"" under EU law is crucial. According to ""Commission v Kingdom of Denmark,"" a person who performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for remuneration is considered a worker, provided the activities are real and genuine and not marginal or ancillary. The case of ""Lawrie-Blum"" further clarifies that any genuine activity, excluding those that are purely marginal and ancillary, qualifies a person for the status of a worker. In Maria's case, although her current work hours have reduced to 15 hours a week, the key question is whether her work is still real and genuine. If her part-time work as a science teacher is considered genuine and not marginal, she should still be regarded as a worker under EU law, thus entitling her to the right of residence.

Moreover, the case of ""Georgios Orfanopoulos and Others v Land Baden-Württemberg"" highlights that migrant workers' right of residence is contingent upon their status as workers or persons seeking employment. If Maria's part-time work is deemed genuine, she should retain her right of residence as a worker.

Regarding alternative options for Maria to reside in Italy beyond being classified as an EU worker, the case of ""Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale v Corradina Baglieri"" suggests that while there is no EU rule prohibiting more favorable treatment for nationals who have worked in non-member countries, this does not directly impact her situation. However, if Maria can demonstrate that she is seeking employment or has other legitimate grounds for residence under EU law, such as family reunification or study, she may still qualify for residence rights.

In conclusion, if Maria's part-time work is considered genuine and not marginal, the refusal of her residence renewal may not be in conformity with EU law. Additionally, she may explore other avenues for residence, such as seeking employment or other legitimate grounds under EU law, to maintain her right to reside in Italy.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,

#### Relevant Facts and Parties

In the case of **C-561/19, Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA**, the dispute centers around Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA (hereafter referred to as the Claimants) against Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA (hereafter referred to as the Defendant). The Claimants are involved in providing services related to railway infrastructure, while the Defendant is a state-owned company responsible for managing railway infrastructure in Italy. The core of the dispute involves the interpretation and application of EU law concerning the procurement processes and the obligations of state-owned enterprises under EU competition law.

#### Procedures in Courts

The case was initially brought before the Italian national court, which sought a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) under Article 234 EC (now Article 267 TFEU). The national court was responsible for determining the necessity and relevance of the questions submitted to the CJEU, as established in cases such as **Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA** and **Grundig Italiana SpA v Ministero delle Finanze**. The national court's role is to ensure that the questions are pertinent to the case at hand and that the CJEU's ruling will assist in delivering a judicial decision.

#### Central Legal Issues

The central legal issue discussed by the CJEU was the interpretation of EU law regarding the obligations of state-owned enterprises in the context of procurement processes. Specifically, the Court examined whether the Defendant, as a state-owned enterprise, was subject to the same competitive procurement rules as private entities under EU law.

#### Relevant Legal Rules

The relevant legal provisions include those related to EU competition law and procurement directives. The CJEU's role is to interpret these provisions to ensure uniform application across Member States. The Court's analysis is guided by the principle that state-owned enterprises must comply with EU competition rules, as established in previous case law.

#### Arguments and Analysis

The Claimants argued that the Defendant, being a state-owned enterprise, should be subject to the same competitive procurement rules as private entities to ensure fair competition. The Defendant contended that certain exemptions applied due to its status as a state-owned enterprise.

The CJEU analyzed these arguments by examining the relevant EU law provisions and previous case law, such as **Case C-415/93 Bosman**, which emphasizes the Court's obligation to provide a ruling on questions concerning the interpretation of Community law. The Court considered whether the Defendant's status as a state-owned enterprise exempted it from the competitive procurement rules.

#### Conclusion

The CJEU concluded that state-owned enterprises, like the Defendant, are subject to the same competitive procurement rules as private entities under EU law. This ensures that state-owned enterprises do not distort competition by receiving preferential treatment. The Court's decision reinforces the principle of fair competition and the uniform application of EU law across Member States.

### Legal Analysis

#### Importance in EU Law

The case of **C-561/19** is significant in the general scheme of EU law as it reinforces the principle that state-owned enterprises must comply with EU competition rules. This decision aligns with the broader objective of ensuring fair competition within the internal market, as emphasized in cases like **Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA** and **Grundig Italiana SpA v Ministero delle Finanze**.

#### Substantive and Procedural Law

Substantively, the case underscores the applicability of EU competition law to state-owned enterprises, ensuring that they do not receive preferential treatment that could distort competition. Procedurally, the case highlights the role of national courts in seeking preliminary rulings from the CJEU to interpret EU law, as established in **Ministero dell'Industria, del Commercio e dell'Artigianato v Lucchini SpA**.

#### Broader Implications

The decision has broader implications for the regulation of state-owned enterprises within the EU. It ensures that these enterprises operate under the same competitive conditions as private entities, promoting a level playing field. This case also reinforces the CJEU's role in providing authoritative interpretations of EU law, ensuring uniform application across Member States.

In conclusion, **C-561/19** is a pivotal case that reinforces the principles of fair competition and the uniform application of EU law, particularly concerning state-owned enterprises. It highlights the collaborative role of national courts and the CJEU in interpreting and applying EU law, ensuring that the internal market operates efficiently and fairly.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"The provided context does not directly address the requested EU law terms and concepts. However, based on general EU law principles and the information given, here is an attempt to provide explanations:

a) Indirect challenge of an EU act: This concept refers to a situation where a Member State or an individual challenges the validity of an EU act indirectly, often through a national court or by arguing that the EU act is not in line with EU fundamental rights or other EU law principles. The context does not provide a direct explanation, but ""Commission v Italy"" and other cases establish that national authorities must show that their legislation addresses an essential interest or overriding requirement.

b) National procedural autonomy: This principle allows Member States to determine their own procedural rules for implementing EU law, as long as they do not undermine the effectiveness of EU law. The context does not explicitly mention national procedural autonomy but does highlight the importance of ensuring that the effectiveness of the Treaty in the field of freedom of establishment is not frustrated by unilateral provisions of the Member States, as seen in ""Reyners"" and other cases.

c) The principle of supremacy: This fundamental principle of EU law establishes that EU law takes precedence over national law. The context does not directly address this concept but illustrates the EU's concern with ensuring that Member States do not frustrate the effectiveness of the Treaty through unilateral provisions, implying the supremacy of EU law.

d) Non-legislative EU act: This term refers to EU acts that are not legislative in nature, such as implementing acts or acts adopted by the European Commission. The context mentions that the concept of implementation comprises both the drawing-up of implementing rules and the application of rules to specific cases by means of acts of individual application, as seen in ""Commission v European Parliament and Council"".

e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights: This concept concerns the scope of EU fundamental rights and when they apply. The context does not provide a direct explanation but highlights the importance of ensuring that EU law is effective, particularly in the field of freedom of establishment, which may involve the application of EU fundamental rights.

In ""Reyners"" and other cases like ""Commission v Greece"", the Court has established that the assessment of certain concepts under EU law, such as the 'exercise of official authority', must take account of the character as European Union law of the limits imposed on permitted exceptions to fundamental freedoms.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","In the dispute between Happy Times and Big Fun, Big Fun's ability to rely on the Safe Toys Directive hinges on the directive's direct effect and its relationship with Swedish national law. The Safe Toys Directive, being a maximum harmonization act, aims to limit the situations when a toy may be banned, allowing prohibition only when a toy is ""obviously dangerous in normal use."" 

The key issue here is that Sweden has not implemented the directive despite the elapsed implementation period. However, the European Court of Justice has established that individuals can invoke directives against Member States under certain conditions, especially when the directive is sufficiently precise and unconditional. 

Big Fun's claim relies on the directive's provisions being directly applicable. Given that the directive sets a clear standard for when toys can be prohibited, Big Fun might argue that the Swedish ban on toys imitating firearms goes beyond what is allowed under the directive. 

In ""Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG v Centrafarm Vertriebsgesellschaft Pharmazeutischer Erzeugnisse mbH,"" the Court considered whether the exercise of a right may constitute a disguised restriction on trade between Member States. Similarly, in ""Boehringer Ingelheim KG, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG, Glaxo Group Ltd, The Wellcome Foundation Ltd, SmithKline Beecham plc, Beecham Group plc, SmithKline & French Laboratories Ltd and Eli Lilly and Co. v Swingward Ltd and Dowelhurst Ltd,"" it was clarified that a derogation from free movement of goods due to trade mark rights cannot be accepted if it constitutes a disguised restriction on trade.

However, the crucial point in this case is whether Big Fun can rely on the directive against Happy Times in a private dispute. The Court has held in various cases that directives can have direct effect in certain circumstances, but typically, this direct effect is considered in the context of public authorities' actions.

In ""The Queen, on the application of: Swedish Match AB and Swedish Match UK Ltd v Secretary of State for Health,"" the Court discussed the measures that can be taken in the context of product safety and marketing. 

Given that the Safe Toys Directive aims to harmonize the rules on toys and that it sets conditions under which toys can be banned, Big Fun could argue that the Swedish law, as applied by Happy Times, contravenes the directive's conditions for prohibition. 

However, without a clear implementation of the directive into Swedish law, and considering the private nature of the dispute, Big Fun's reliance on the directive might face challenges. The Court's approach in cases like ""Criminal proceedings against Harry Franzén"" and ""Criminal proceedings against Gunnar Nilsson, Per Olov Hagelgren and Solweig Arrborn"" suggests that national rules applying without distinction as to the origin of products do not necessarily fall within the scope of Article 30 of the Treaty.

In conclusion, Big Fun's ability to rely on the Safe Toys Directive would depend on the court's interpretation of the directive's direct effect in private disputes and its relationship with Swedish national law. The directive's provisions on limiting bans on toys to those ""obviously dangerous in normal use"" could potentially protect Big Fun from the Swedish ban, but this would require the court to consider the directive's applicability and the implications of Sweden's failure to implement it.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","Here are the definitions and explanations of the requested EU law terms and concepts:

a) Special legislative procedure: The special legislative procedure refers to a specific procedure for adopting EU legislation, which is determined by the legal basis of the measure. As noted in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union,"" the legal basis of a measure determines the procedure to be followed in adopting that measure. In some cases, the Treaty specifies a special legislative procedure, which may involve the Council or the European Parliament having a more significant role in the adoption of the measure.

b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs): MEQRs refer to national legislation that hinders, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade. According to settled case-law, as seen in ""Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany"" and ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands,"" such measures are prohibited under Article 28 EC. The Court has consistently held that this prohibition covers all legislation of the Member States that is capable of hindering intra-Community trade, as established in ""Dassonville.""

c) Concerted practices: Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the context regarding concerted practices.

d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Although not directly defined in the provided context, it can be inferred that enforcement actions or infringement proceedings refer to actions taken by the Commission against Member States for non-compliance with EU law. The context mentions that the Commission took actions against various Member States, such as in ""Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany"" and ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands,"" for failing to fulfill their obligations under EU law.

e) Proportionality: The principle of proportionality requires that national provisions must be appropriate for securing the attainment of the objective pursued and not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain it. As seen in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands,"" national legislation that constitutes a MEQR can be justified if it meets this test. The Court has consistently applied this principle, as in ""Radiosistemi"" and ""ATRAL,"" to ensure that national measures do not excessively restrict intra-Community trade.","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law.","To address Cynthia's situation, we must consider the principles established in EU law regarding the free movement of workers and the rights of EU citizens.

a) The Belgian authorities' decision to no longer consider Cynthia an ""EU worker"" due to her change in employment situation may not be in accordance with EU law. According to the Court's reasoning in ""Raymond Vander Elst v Office des Migrations Internationales,"" the application of national rules of public policy governing employment relationships to workers sent temporarily to another Member State does not necessarily distort competition or lead to worker exploitation. In Cynthia's case, her change from full-time to part-time work does not inherently suggest that she is no longer a worker within the meaning of EU law. The Court has emphasized that the concept of a worker is not defined by the number of hours worked but by the fact that the person is engaged in effective and genuine activities, excluding activities on such a small scale as to be regarded as purely marginal and ancillary (not directly addressed in the provided context but relevant general principle). Therefore, without more specific details on her part-time work being marginal, it's arguable that Cynthia remains an EU worker.

b) The rejection of Cynthia's application for a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, solely on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen, is not in accordance with EU law. As established in ""Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon,"" Article 39(4) EC (now Article 45(4) TFEU) allows Member States to restrict access to certain public service positions to their own nationals, but this exception is narrowly construed and applies to positions that involve a special relationship of allegiance to the State. Positions in the Ministry do not necessarily imply such a special relationship, and a blanket restriction based solely on nationality for jobs not explicitly mentioned in Article 45(4) TFEU would likely be considered discriminatory and thus prohibited under Article 45 TFEU and Article 7 of the Treaty.

c) The rejection of Cynthia's application for a job at a private academy due to not being a Belgian citizen and not meeting linguistic requirements could be considered in line with EU law under certain conditions. The requirement of an advanced level of other EU languages for a tutoring position that involves teaching in those languages could be seen as a proportionate and objective requirement for the job, given the nature of the position and the need to communicate effectively with students who are exchange students. This would align with the principle that while nationality-based discrimination is prohibited, certain job requirements that are objectively justified and not discriminatory in effect can be permissible. However, the specifics would depend on a detailed analysis of whether the linguistic requirements are genuinely necessary and proportionate for the job, as also touched upon in ""Commission of the European Communities v Grand Duchy of Luxemburg,"" regarding the application of national legislation to workers from other Member States. 

In summary, EU law protects workers and citizens from discriminatory practices based on nationality, but allows for certain exceptions and requirements that are objectively justified. The acceptability of the Belgian authorities' actions in each scenario depends on the specifics of the situation and the application of these principles.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","The dispute between Big Money and Good Enough revolves around the interpretation of EU law and its relationship with national law, specifically regarding the construction of a shelter in the new company headquarters. Good Enough argues that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety, which requires the construction of a shelter, should be set aside in favor of Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive, which prohibits Member States from introducing further requirements on construction work beyond what is laid down in Articles 5-15 of the directive.

First, it is essential to consider the principle of legal certainty and the relationship between EU law and national law. According to the case-law, as seen in ""Kingdom of Spain v Commission of the European Communities"" and ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities,"" in the context of decisions on the clearance of accounts, the reasons for a decision are considered adequate if the Member State was closely involved in the decision-making process and was aware of the reasons for the Commission's decision. Although this principle is applied in a different context, it highlights the importance of considering the involvement of Member States in the decision-making process and their awareness of the relevant laws.

In this case, the Safe Building Directive was adopted in 2015 and implemented by Fantasia in 2016 through the 2016 Construction Act. Article 20 of the directive explicitly states that Member States may not introduce further requirements on construction work beyond what is laid down in Articles 5-15. However, the 1948 Law on Public Safety, which requires the construction of a shelter, was not repealed and remains in effect.

The crucial issue here is whether the 1948 Law on Public Safety can be considered a ""further requirement"" within the meaning of Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive. If it is, then Good Enough's argument that paragraph 138 should be set aside might have merit. 

However, as seen in ""Georgios Agorastoudis and Others v Goodyear Hellas ABEE,"" the Court has held that a Member State's failure to fulfill its obligations under EU law can be established if national legislation is not in line with EU directives. In this case, the 2016 Construction Act reproduces Articles 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive, but the 1948 Law on Public Safety remains in effect.

The Court in ""Belgische Staat v Cobelfret NV"" established that the principle of legal certainty may lead to restrictions on the opportunity of relying on a provision interpreted by the Court, but only exceptionally and under specific conditions. 

Given that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and has not been explicitly repealed or amended, it appears that it still applies. The Safe Building Directive does not explicitly mention shelters as part of any building type, and Article 20 of the directive prohibits further requirements beyond what is laid down in Articles 5-15.

In resolving this dispute, I would consider that the 1948 Law on Public Safety and the Safe Building Directive address different aspects of building regulations. The 1948 Law concerns public safety, specifically the requirement for shelters, while the Safe Building Directive aims to harmonize building standards for trade in construction work on the internal market.

As the 2016 Construction Act implemented the Safe Building Directive but did not repeal the 1948 Law on Public Safety, I would conclude that Good Enough's argument that paragraph 138 should be set aside due to the Safe Building Directive is not sufficient to override the contractual obligation to comply with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019. Therefore, I would find that Good Enough is liable for breaching the contract due to not including a shelter in the building as required by paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","Here are the definitions and explanations of the requested EU law terms and concepts:

a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP)

The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) is a law-making process in the European Union where the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have equal say in adopting legislation. According to the case law, ""it is not procedures that define the legal basis of a measure but the legal basis of a measure that determines the procedures to be followed in adopting that measure"" (""European Parliament v Council of the European Union""). This highlights the importance of identifying the correct legal basis for a measure, which in turn determines the procedure to be followed, including the OLP.

b) State liability

State liability refers to the liability of Member States for breaches of EU law. The concept of state liability was developed by the Court of Justice, taking into account factors such as ""the complexity of the situations to be regulated, difficulties in the application or interpretation of the texts and, more particularly, the margin of discretion available to the author of the act in question"" (""Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others""). This concept ensures that Member States are held accountable for their actions and are incentivized to implement EU law correctly.

c) The preliminary ruling procedure

The preliminary ruling procedure, governed by Article 267 TFEU, allows national courts to refer questions on the interpretation of EU law to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. This procedure ensures the uniform interpretation and application of EU law across Member States. Although not directly addressed in the provided context, it is an essential aspect of EU law, enabling national courts to seek guidance on EU law issues.

d) Indirect effect

Indirect effect refers to the obligation on national courts to interpret national law in conformity with EU law, particularly in areas where EU law has not been fully harmonized. The Court of Justice has established that national courts must interpret national law in a way that is consistent with EU law, even if it requires setting aside national law that conflicts with EU law (""Pupino""). This principle ensures that EU law is given effect at the national level, even in the absence of directly applicable provisions.

e) Subsidiarity

Subsidiarity is a principle enshrined in Article 5(3) TEU, which states that the Union should only take action if it is necessary and if the objectives cannot be achieved by the Member States alone. This principle aims to ensure that decisions are taken at the most local level possible, and that the EU only intervenes when necessary. The concept of subsidiarity is closely linked to the principle of proportionality, which requires that EU action should not exceed what is necessary to achieve the desired objective. The Court of Justice has recognized the importance of subsidiarity in ensuring that the EU does not overstep its competences (""European Commission v Republic of Austria"").","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,
"Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B.

The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not? (Reason as with A(i) above), yet use question B facts.) ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation?

In other words describe several steps applying the law you have learned to these facts and demonstrating your understanding of how they fit within the broader context of the EU legal system functions.","I'll address each sub-question from an EU law perspective, supporting my answers with relevant references.

**A. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law?**

The Italian public school's decision to deny Anna's school diploma employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen appears to be discriminatory on grounds of nationality. According to the case-law, a measure that draws a distinction on the basis of residence is liable to operate mainly to the detriment of nationals of other Member States, as non-residents are often foreigners (""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic."", paragraph 14). This type of requirement directly negates the freedom to provide services, as it makes it impossible for persons established in other Member States to provide services in Italy (""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic."", paragraph 20).

In this scenario, the Italian public school's decision seems to be restricting Anna's access to employment based on her nationality, which is a form of discrimination prohibited by EU law. The Court has established that such a measure can only be justified if the public interest relied on is not already safeguarded by the rules to which the service provider is subject in the Member State in which it is established (""Commission of the European Communities v Spain"", paragraph 43). However, in this case, there is no indication that the Italian public school has considered such justifications.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the Italian public school's decision does not appear to be in conformity with EU law, specifically the principles of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality.

**A. ii) What remedies might be available to Anna?**

If Anna wishes to challenge the Italian public school's decision, she may bring court proceedings against it. According to the case-law, the question whether a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations must be determined by reference to the situation prevailing in the Member State at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion, and the Court cannot take account of any subsequent changes (""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic."", paragraph 10). 

Anna could potentially bring a case before the Italian courts, arguing that the school's decision constitutes discriminatory treatment on grounds of nationality, which is prohibited by EU law. If the Italian courts fail to address her concerns, she may also consider bringing a case before the European Court of Justice, potentially under Article 267 TFEU (preliminary rulings), or alternatively, the Commission could take action against Italy for failing to fulfill its obligations under EU law (""Commission v Greece""). 

**B. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law?**

The Portuguese authority's decision to refuse Carmen a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen appears to be based on an incorrect understanding of EU law. According to the case-law, the right of entry into the territory of a Member State granted to a third-country national who is the spouse of a national of a Member State derives from the family relationship alone (""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Spain"", paragraph 28). 

In this scenario, Carmen, as the spouse of a Union citizen (Juan), has a right to reside in Portugal, as a Member State. The Portuguese authority's decision seems to be negating this right, which is protected by EU law.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the Portuguese authority's decision does not appear to be in conformity with EU law, specifically the principles of free movement and family reunification.

**B. ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation?**

If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits to spouses of Union citizens, like Carmen, the European Commission could take action against Portugal for failing to fulfill its obligations under EU law. The Commission could send a reasoned opinion to Portugal, and if the issue persists, it could refer the matter to the European Court of Justice (""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic."", paragraph 25).

Additionally, Juan, as a Union citizen, could also consider bringing a case before the Portuguese courts or the European Court of Justice, arguing that Portugal's refusal to grant a residence permit to his spouse constitutes a breach of EU law, specifically the free movement provisions.

The Commission could also consider taking infringement proceedings against Portugal under Article 258 TFEU, which would allow the European Court of Justice to review Portugal's compliance with EU law and potentially impose penalties if it finds that Portugal has failed to fulfill its obligations. 

In any case, the apprehension of internal difficulties cannot justify a failure by a Member State to comply with its obligations under Community law (""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities"", paragraph 78).","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","Here are the answers to your questions:

1. The duty of Member States to fulfil their EU obligations is rooted in Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), which requires Member States to take all necessary measures to ensure the fulfilment of their obligations under EU law. This provision is often referred to in cases such as ""Commission v Italy"" where the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has consistently held that Member States are bound by the objectives of EU directives, while having a margin of discretion in achieving those objectives.

2. If the European Union suspects that Italy is breaching Union law, specifically Directive (EU) 2016/2284, the European Commission can initiate formal action under Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Commission can send a letter of formal notice to Italy, requesting it to provide information and explanations on the alleged breach. If Italy's response is unsatisfactory, the Commission can issue a reasoned opinion, specifying the measures that Italy must take to comply with EU law. If Italy still fails to comply, the Commission can refer the case to the CJEU.

3. If the CJEU finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy is required to take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment. If Italy fails to comply with the judgment, the Commission can bring the case back to the CJEU under Article 260(2) TFEU, which may result in the imposition of a lump sum or penalty payment on Italy. The Court has previously demonstrated its willingness to impose financial penalties on Member States that fail to comply with its judgments, as seen in various infringement cases, including those concerning environmental directives. The aim is to ensure that Member States take effective action to comply with EU law and to maintain the uniform application of EU law across all Member States.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","a) The context provided does not explicitly discuss the difference between absolute and relative rights or provide specific examples from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, in general, absolute rights are those that cannot be restricted or limited under any circumstances, whereas relative rights can be subject to certain limitations. 

b) The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has consistently held that fundamental rights form an integral part of the general principles of law, whose observance the Court ensures. This approach, as seen in cases like ""Liselotte Hauer v Land Rheinland-Pfalz,"" ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union,"" and others, reflects a shift towards acknowledging and protecting fundamental rights within the EU legal framework. Two reasons for this direction include: 
1) The need to ensure that EU actions and laws are compatible with the fundamental rights recognized by the Member States' constitutional traditions, as highlighted in ""Liselotte Hauer v Land Rheinland-Pfalz"" and other cases. 
2) The importance of aligning EU law with international treaties for the protection of human rights, such as the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, to which the Member States have collaborated or are signatories.

c) The three principal sources or “bills of rights” of EU fundamental rights are: 
1) The constitutional traditions common to the Member States, 
2) The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), and 
3) The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. These sources are recognized in various cases, including ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union,"" ""Bernard Connolly v Commission of the European Communities,"" and others, as guiding the CJEU in its protection of fundamental rights. They are referenced throughout the EU treaties, particularly in the context of ensuring that EU actions respect fundamental rights, but specific treaty articles are not mentioned in the provided context.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","A) The Italian authorities' decision to refuse Maria's residence renewal on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation may not be in conformity with EU law. According to the case law, a person who pursues activities that are real and genuine, to the exclusion of activities on such a small scale as to be regarded as purely marginal and ancillary, is entitled to freedom of movement as a worker. In ""Lawrie-Blum"", the Court established that a person performing services for and under the direction of another person in return for which they receive remuneration must be considered a worker. Although Maria's working hours have decreased to 15 hours a week, her activities as a science teacher can still be considered real and genuine. The Court has also ruled that the fact that an employee is placed at a disadvantage in regard to working conditions compared to their colleagues residing in the country of their employer has a direct effect on the exercise of their right to freedom of movement within the Community, as seen in ""Ledoux"". 

In ""Antonissen"", the Court stated that migrant workers' right of residence is subject to the condition that the person remains a worker or, where relevant, a person seeking employment. However, it is not clear from the information provided whether Maria's reduced working hours render her activities as ""purely marginal and ancillary"". A decisive factor would be whether her 15-hour workweek is substantial enough to qualify as a worker under EU law.

B) Beyond being an 'EU worker', Maria may have other options to reside in Italy. According to ""Georgios Orfanopoulos and Others (C-482/01) and Raffaele Oliveri (C-493/01) v Land Baden-Württemberg"", a person may derive the right of residence from other provisions of Community law. For instance, if Maria can demonstrate that she has sufficient financial resources and comprehensive health insurance, she might be able to rely on her right to reside in Italy as a non-worker EU citizen under Article 21 TFEU (formerly Article 18 EC). However, the specifics of her situation and applicable provisions would need to be examined further to determine the viability of this option.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,
"Throughout the course you have been trained in reading and analysing the case law of the European Court of Justice. Below is a judgment of the European Court of Justice, C-561/19, Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA Your assignment: 1. Present the decision of the case (7 p.). This presentation should include, in your own words, a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) 2.

When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","I'm happy to help you with your question. However, I notice that the context provided does not include any information about the case C-561/19, Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA. 

Given the information provided in the context, I can only provide general principles related to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and its procedures.

When a national court refers questions to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC, the ECJ is, in principle, bound to give a ruling [Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA (C-295/04)]. This is because it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought to determine the need for a preliminary ruling and the relevance of the questions submitted to the ECJ [Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA (C-295/04); Grundig Italiana SpA v Ministero delle Finanze].

The ECJ's role in preliminary ruling proceedings is to provide an interpretation of EU law that enables the national court to resolve the dispute before it [Ministero dell'Industria, del Commercio e dell'Artigianato v Lucchini SpA]. In doing so, the ECJ must ensure that its interpretation is consistent with EU law and that it provides clear and unequivocal guidance to the national court.

In general, the ECJ's decisions in preliminary ruling cases have significant implications for the development of EU law and its application in Member States. By providing authoritative interpretations of EU law, the ECJ helps to ensure consistency and coherence in the application of EU law across the EU [Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities].

However, without specific information about the case C-561/19, Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA, I am unable to provide a detailed analysis of the decision or its importance in the general scheme of EU law. 

If you provide more context or information about the case, I would be happy to try and assist you further.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"The provided context does not define or explain the terms ""indirect challenge of an EU act,"" ""national procedural autonomy,"" ""the principle of supremacy,"" ""non-legislative EU act,"" or the ""field of application of EU fundamental rights."" However, the provided text does discuss the concept of the ‘exercise of official authority’ within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 45 EC. According to settled case-law, the assessment of this concept must account for the character as European Union law of the limits imposed by that provision on the permitted exceptions to the principle of freedom of establishment, so as to ensure that the effectiveness of the Treaty in the field of freedom of establishment is not frustrated by unilateral provisions of the Member States (see ""Reyners,"" ""Commission v Greece,"" and ""Commission v Portugal"").

Additionally, the concept of ""implementation"" comprises both the drawing-up of implementing rules and the application of rules to specific cases by means of acts of individual application (see ""Commission v Council"").

Finally, it is for the competent national authorities to show that their legislation addresses an essential interest within the meaning of Articles 45 and 46 EC or an overriding requirement relating to the general interest as laid down in the case-law and that that legislation conforms to the principle of proportionality (see ""Commission v Netherlands,"" ""Commission v Belgium,"" and ""Commission v France"").","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","Big Fun may be able to rely on the Safe Toys Directive, despite Sweden's failure to implement it. The directive aims to harmonize the rules regarding the production, marketing, and sale of toys within the EU, with the goal of facilitating trade and limiting the circumstances under which a toy can be banned. Given that it is a maximum harmonization act, it seeks to comprehensively regulate the area, further restricting the Member States' powers.

The first question is whether the Swedish ban on toys imitating firearms is compatible with EU law, specifically the free movement of goods. National measures that make marketing more difficult can impede trade between Member States, as seen in ""Proceedings for compulsory reconstruction against Smanor SA.,"" where a requirement to sell a product under a different name was considered a potential impediment to trade. Similarly, Happy Times' request for a ban on 'Bang' could be seen as a measure that hinders trade.

However, restrictions on trade may be justified under certain circumstances. As seen in ""The Queen, on the application of: Swedish Match AB and Swedish Match UK Ltd v Secretary of State for Health,"" Member States may be required to authorize the marketing of certain products or even prohibit the marketing of products under certain conditions. In this case, the Safe Toys Directive restricts the circumstances under which a toy may be banned.

The question then becomes whether the Swedish law prohibiting 'immoral or inappropriate toys' and toys imitating firearms is a disguised restriction on trade between Member States. In ""Boehringer Ingelheim KG, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG, Glaxo Group Ltd, The Wellcome Foundation Ltd, SmithKline Beecham plc, Beecham Group plc, SmithKline & French Laboratories Ltd and Eli Lilly and Co. v Swingward Ltd and Dowelhurst Ltd,"" it was clarified that a trade mark proprietor's opposition to repackaging cannot be accepted if it constitutes a disguised restriction on trade between Member States. In ""Hoffmann-La Roche,"" the Court considered whether the exercise of a trade mark right could be a disguised restriction on trade if the proprietor put identical products in different packages on the market in different member states.

The Swedish law may be considered a disguised restriction on trade, as it has been in place for a long time, and the 'Bang' may not be 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. Furthermore, as seen in ""Criminal proceedings against Gunnar Nilsson, Per Olov Hagelgren and Solweig Arrborn,"" an obligation on all traders to have their products distributed by a method authorized under national rules which apply without distinction as to the origin of the products in question, and so do not affect the marketing of products from other Member States differently from that of domestic products, does not fall within the scope of Article 30 of the Treaty. However, in this case, the rule *does* affect the marketing of products from other Member States differently from that of domestic products.

Therefore, Big Fun may be able to rely on the Safe Toys Directive to challenge the Swedish law, arguing that it is incompatible with the directive's requirements for banning toys, particularly the 'obviously dangerous in normal use' standard.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","a) The information provided does not discuss special legislative procedures.

b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), as prohibited by Article 28 EC (now Article 34 TFEU), encompass all Member State legislation capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade. This principle is established in ""Dassonville"" and affirmed in cases such as ""Deutscher Apothekerverband"", ""Rosengren and Others"", ""Commission v Netherlands"", ""Ludwigs-Apotheke"", ""Commission v Denmark,"" and ""Commission v Austria."" Article 30 of the Treaty (now Article 36 TFEU) also concerns MEQRs.

c) The information provided does not discuss concerted practices.

d) The information provided does not discuss enforcement actions/infringement proceedings.

e) National legislation that constitutes a measure having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions can be justified on grounds of public interest under Article 30 EC or by imperative requirements, as seen in ""Commission v Italy"" and ""Commission v Finland"". However, such a provision must be appropriate for achieving the objective and must not exceed what is necessary to achieve it, as seen in ""Radiosistemi"" and ""ATRAL"".","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment.

a) The information provided does not directly address whether a change in employment status, from full-time to part-time, can disqualify an EU citizen from being considered an ""EU worker"" for residence permit purposes. However, ""Mouvement contre le racisme, l'antisémitisme et la xénophobie ASBL (MRAX) v Belgian State"" indicates that a Member State cannot refuse to issue a residence permit to a third-country national married to a Member State national or issue an expulsion order solely because their visa expired before applying for the permit, provided they entered the territory lawfully. The key factor here is not the validity of the initial entry document but the individual's current status and compliance with other relevant requirements.

b) Regarding Cynthia's application for a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, which was rejected due to her lack of Belgian citizenship, ""Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon"" states that Member States can restrict admission of foreign nationals to certain public service positions. These positions presume a special relationship of allegiance to the State and reciprocity of rights and duties that form the foundation of nationality, as supported by ""Commission v Belgium"". However, once a worker is admitted into the public service, they are entitled to the protections of Article 39(1) to (3) EC, as noted in ""Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon"" and ""Sotgiu"".

c) The information provided does not address the legality of rejecting Cynthia's application for a tutoring position at a private academy based on citizenship and linguistic requirements. However, ""Commission of the European Communities v Grand Duchy of Luxemburg"" suggests that while Member States can apply their legislation or collective labor agreements to anyone employed within their territory, even temporarily, this is conditional. The condition is that the workers temporarily working in the host Member State must not already enjoy the same or essentially comparable protection by virtue of obligations to which their employer is already subject in the Member State in which it is established. This principle may be relevant if the linguistic requirements imposed are disproportionate or discriminatory.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","In the case between Big Money and Good Enough, the central EU law issue revolves around the potential conflict between Fantasia's 1948 Law on Public Safety, specifically paragraph 138 requiring shelters in buildings designed for more than 10 people, and the 2015 Safe Building Directive. Good Enough argues that Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive, which prohibits Member States from introducing further requirements on construction work beyond those in Articles 5-15, should override the national law.

The court must consider whether the 1948 law constitutes an additional requirement on construction work that conflicts with the Directive. If the 1948 law does impose requirements beyond the scope of Articles 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive, the court must consider its effect.

Relevant case law indicates that legal certainty is paramount; however, this may be limited under specific circumstances. According to ""Belgische Staat v Cobelfret NV,"" the Court may restrict the opportunity to rely on a provision it has interpreted if those concerned acted in good faith and there is a risk of serious difficulties. It is not clear from the context if this applies in the current case.

Furthermore, in the context of justifications, the Court has acknowledged that the balanced allocation of the power to impose taxes between the Member States could be considered a legitimate requirement in conjunction with other grounds of justification, as noted in ""Jobra Vermögensverwaltungs-Gesellschaft mbH v Finanzamt Amstetten Melk Scheibbs."" However, this case law does not automatically apply, and it is not clear from the context if it applies in the present case.

According to ""Georgios Agorastoudis and Others v Goodyear Hellas ABEE,"" a Member State failed to fulfill its obligations when it did not provide workers with the protection envisaged by a directive. This was the case when the meaning of an exemption laid down in the directive was clear.

The court must ascertain whether the 1948 law can be maintained alongside the Safe Building Directive or whether the directive's objective of harmonizing building standards precludes such additional national requirements.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) is not defined in the provided text. The case law provided indicates that the legal basis of a measure determines the procedure to be followed in adopting that measure, as seen in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union.""

b) State liability, particularly concerning legislative measures, considers the complexity of the situations being regulated, difficulties in interpreting texts, and the discretion available to the act's author, as stated in ""Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others."" The system of rules regarding Article 215 of the Treaty takes these factors into account.

c) The preliminary ruling procedure is not explicitly defined in the provided text. However, the texts do mention the division of jurisdiction between Community Courts and national courts regarding liability for damage, as stated in ""European Commission v Systran SA and Systran Luxembourg SA.""

d) Indirect effect is not defined in the provided text.

e) Subsidiarity is not defined in the provided text. However, the text does refer to situations where the Treaty does not explicitly confer powers on the Community institutions. In such cases, powers may be implied if necessary to carry out the Community's functions and attain its objectives, as stated in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union."" This fills the gap when no specific provisions exist.","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,
"Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B. Juan is Spanish and lives in Madrid with his Argentine wife Carmen. The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not? (Reason as with A(i) above), yet use question B facts.) ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation? (Include whether it can bring a court proceeding against Portugal.) Your assignment: Answer each sub-question from a EU law perspective. Support your answers by referring at every opportunity during your answers when relevant references are made of sources of EU law. Make clear which sub-question you are answering. Where appropriate provide specific examples (like in math class), not simply an unexplained answer. In other words describe several steps applying the law you have learned to these facts and demonstrating your understanding of how they fit within the broader context of the EU legal system functions.","A. i) The Italian public school's decision to deny Anna employment based on her citizenship likely violates EU law. According to ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic,"" a measure that draws a distinction based on residence is liable to operate mainly to the detriment of nationals of other Member States. It is immaterial whether the contested measure affects, in some circumstances, nationals of the State in question resident in other parts of the national territory as well as nationals of other Member States. ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"" further elaborates that for a measure to be treated as discriminatory, it does not need to advantage all nationals of the State in question or disadvantage only nationals of other Member States.

A. ii) The context does not provide specific information about remedies available to Anna.

B. i) The Portuguese authority's decision to deny Carmen a residence permit may violate EU law. The case of ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Spain"" states that the right of entry into the territory of a Member State granted to a third-country national who is the spouse of a national of a Member State derives from the family relationship alone. Therefore, the issuance of a residence permit to Carmen should be regarded as a measure by Portugal serving to prove her individual position with regard to provisions of Community law, not as a measure giving rise to rights.

B. ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits, the Commission can bring a court proceeding against Portugal. According to ""Commission of the European Communities v Portuguese Republic,"" the question of whether a Member State has failed to fulfill its obligations must be determined by reference to the situation prevailing in the Member State at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion, and the Court cannot take account of any subsequent changes. Furthermore, ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities"" states that the apprehension of internal difficulties cannot justify a failure by a Member State to comply with its obligations under Community law.","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","The provided context does not contain information about Treaty articles concerning the duty of Member States to fulfill EU obligations, what formal actions the EU can take against a Member State suspected of breaching Union law, or the consequences if a Member State fails to comply with a judgment from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).

However, the provided context does offer some insight into how the CJEU addresses potential breaches of EU law related to directives. Specifically, it highlights that when a Member State is accused of infringing Article 4 of Directive 75/442, which requires Member States to ensure waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health or harming the environment, the CJEU acknowledges that Member States have discretion in determining the necessary measures. As seen in ""Commission v Italy ('San Rocco')"", the provision is binding on the Member States as to the objective to be achieved, whilst leaving to the Member States a margin of discretion in assessing the need for such measures. The CJEU also takes the position that a failure to meet the objectives of Article 4 does not automatically mean that a Member State has failed to fulfill its obligations. However, as seen in ""Commission v Italy ('San Rocco')"", if a situation persists and leads to a significant deterioration in the environment over a protracted period without action from the authorities, this may suggest that the Member State has exceeded its discretionary powers.

Furthermore, regarding evidence, in ""Commission v Italy"", the Court suggests that a lack of information about certain regions may be sufficient evidence of a failure to comply with Article 6 of the directive. However, for other regions, the Commission must provide sufficient information to prove the alleged failure.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,

Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","1.  a) In ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix,"" the Court considered a dispute regarding the statement of reasons in a decision affecting an individual. The parties were the Commission and Frédéric Daffix, and the dispute centered on whether the decision provided sufficient details for Daffix to understand its basis and for the Court to review its legality [12].

 b) The judgment context provided does not detail the specific procedures that occurred in particular courts, nor does it explain why those procedures occurred.

 c) The central legal issue discussed by the Court of Justice was whether the contested decision provided a proper statement of reasons [12].

 d) The relevant legal rule discussed relates to the requirement that a decision adversely affecting a person should state the reasons on which it is based [12].

 e) In ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix,"" the Court, at paragraph 32, referred to established case-law, stipulating that the purpose of requiring a statement of reasons is to provide the concerned individual with enough detail to assess the decision's validity and to enable the Court to review its legality [12]. In ""Commission of the European Communities v Département du Loiret and Scott SA,"" the Court stated that the statement of reasons must be appropriate to the act in question, disclosing the institution's reasoning in a clear and unequivocal way, enabling those concerned to understand the reasons and the Court to exercise its power of review [43]. The requirements for the statement of reasons depend on the circumstances of each case, including the content of the measure, the reasons given, and the interest of the addressees in obtaining explanations [43].

 f) In ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix,"" after observing that, according to the case-law, the requirement that a decision adversely affecting a person should state the reasons on which it is based is intended to provide the person concerned with details sufficient to allow him to ascertain whether the decision is well founded and to enable the Court to review its legality [12], the Court then considered whether a proper statement of reasons was provided by the contested decision [12]. The judgment context provided does not provide a conclusion regarding the issue.

2. The ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"" case highlights the importance of providing adequate reasoning in EU administrative decisions. Referencing ""Michel v Parliament,"" ""Lux v Court of Auditors,"" and ""Pérez-Mínguez Casariego v Commission,"" the Court emphasizes that individuals affected by a decision must be able to understand its basis and have the means to challenge it legally. This principle is crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability within the EU system.

Furthermore, the case relates to broader principles of judicial review. In ""Commission v Département du Loiret and Scott SA,"" the Court reiterated that the statement of reasons must enable the competent Community Court to exercise its power of review [43]. In ""Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France"" and ""Bertelsmann and Sony Corporation of America v Impala,"" the judgment highlights the need for clear and unequivocal reasoning to allow for effective judicial oversight [43].

In ""Commission v Finland,"" ""Commission v Italy,"" ""Commission v European Parliament and Council of the European Union,"" ""Ireland v Commission,"" and ""Italy v Commission,"" the Court emphasized the importance of clarity and precision in applications to the Court, as stipulated by Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure [30, 22, 27, 103]. This procedural requirement ensures that defendants can prepare their defense and that the Court can rule effectively on the application without ruling *ultra petita* [30, 22, 103]. Similarly, ""Z v European Parliament"" highlights the need for appeals to precisely indicate the contested elements of the judgment and the legal arguments supporting the request to set it aside [33].","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","The Court ensures that fundamental rights form an integral part of the general principles of law. To do this, as seen in cases such as ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union,"" ""Bernard Connolly v Commission of the European Communities,"" ""Yassin Abdullah Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council of the European Union and Commission of the European Communities,"" ""Laserdisken ApS v Kulturministeriet,"" ""Dieter Krombach v André Bamberski,"" and ""Eugen Schmidberger, Internationale Transporte und Planzüge v Republik Österreich,"" the Court draws inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States and from international instruments for the protection of human rights to which the Member States are signatories. The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) has special significance in this regard. As stated in ""Liselotte Hauer v Land Rheinland-Pfalz,"" measures incompatible with fundamental rights recognized by Member State constitutions are unacceptable in the Community, and international treaties for human rights protection can supply guidelines. The Joint Declaration of the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission of April 5, 1977, acknowledged this conception, referring to rights guaranteed by Member State constitutions and the ECHR.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","A) The Italian authorities' decision to refuse Maria's residence renewal based on her reduced working hours may not be in conformity with EU law. According to Article 39 EC, as highlighted in ""Andrea Raccanelli v Max-Planck-Gesellschaft,"" freedom of movement for workers entails the abolition of discrimination based on nationality regarding employment, remuneration, and other conditions of work. A person who performs services for another in return for remuneration is considered a worker within the framework of Article 39 EC. As established in ""Commission v Kingdom of Denmark,"" any person pursuing real and genuine activities, excluding those purely marginal and ancillary, is entitled to freedom of movement as a worker, citing ""Lawrie-Blum"" and ""Collins"". Moreover, the ""Commission v Kingdom of Denmark"" case also notes that an employee might be deterred from seeking employment in another Member State if they face the prospect of lower salaries than comparable employees in that other Member State, which would affect their right to freedom of movement.

B) Beyond being a ""EU worker,"" Maria's right of residence is subject to the condition that she remains a worker or a person seeking employment, according to ""Orfanopoulos and Oliveri,"" citing ""Antonissen,"" unless she derives that right from other provisions of Community law.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,
"Throughout the course you have been trained in reading and analysing the case law of the European Court of Justice. Below is a judgment of the European Court of Justice, C-561/19, Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA Your assignment: 1. Present the decision of the case (7 p.). This presentation should include, in your own words, a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) 2.

Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","Based on the provided context, I can only address the procedural aspects of preliminary rulings and the duty to provide adequate reasoning for EU acts. I cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of ""C-561/19, Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA"" as its details are not included in the context.

Regarding the preliminary ruling procedure, the Court of Justice's role is to interpret EU law when national courts seek clarification. As established in ""Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA"", ""Antonio Cannito v Fondiaria Sai SpA"" and ""Nicolò Tricarico (C-297/04) and Pasqualina Murgolo (C-298/04) v Assitalia SpA"", as well as ""Grundig Italiana SpA v Ministero delle Finanze"" and ""Ministero dell'Industria, del Commercio e dell'Artigianato v Lucchini SpA,"" it is solely up to the national court to determine the necessity and relevance of the questions it submits for a preliminary ruling. Consequently, the Court of Justice is, in principle, bound to give a ruling when the questions concern the interpretation of EU law, as also noted in ""Teresa Cicala v Regione Siciliana"". However, the assessment of facts in the case remains the sole responsibility of the national court.

Concerning the statement of reasons for EU acts, the Court has consistently held that Article 253 EC (now Article 296 TFEU) requires the reasoning to be appropriate to the act in question. This reasoning must be clear and unequivocal, enabling the persons concerned to understand the justification for the measure and allowing the competent court to exercise its power of review, as articulated in ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities"" and ""Italian Republic v Council of the European Union"".

Finally, in the context of appeals, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction to review the legal classification of facts and the legal inferences drawn from them by the Court of First Instance, as confirmed in ""European Parliament v Carlo Ripa di Meana, Leoluca Orlando and Gastone Parigi"". This is considered a question of law subject to review by the Court of Justice.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"Regarding the concepts requested, the provided context offers information pertinent to the idea behind the principle of supremacy, albeit without explicitly using the term.

c) The principle of supremacy:
The case law, notably in ""European Commission v Kingdom of Belgium"", ""European Commission v Republic of Austria"", ""European Commission v French Republic"", ""European Commission v Grand Duchy of Luxemburg"", and ""European Commission v Federal Republic of Germany"", highlights a crucial aspect concerning the relationship between EU law and national provisions. When assessing the concept of the ‘exercise of official authority’ as defined in the first paragraph of Article 45 EC, it is imperative to acknowledge that the limits imposed by this Treaty provision on permitted exceptions to the principle of freedom of establishment possess the character of European Union law. This approach is essential to ensure that the effectiveness of the Treaty, particularly in the domain of freedom of establishment, is not undermined or frustrated by unilateral provisions enacted by the Member States. This understanding is consistent with settled case-law, as further demonstrated by ""Reyners"", ""Commission v Greece"", and ""Commission v Portugal"", which collectively underscore the necessity for EU law to maintain its effectiveness against potentially conflicting national measures.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","The dispute between Happy Times and Big Fun involves a conflict between Swedish national law and the unimplemented EU Safe Toys Directive, which is a maximum harmonization act. Big Fun's ability to rely on this Directive depends on the interplay of national and EU law principles, as illuminated by the provided context.

The Safe Toys Directive aims to regulate all issues related to the production, marketing, and sale of toys in Member States, with the explicit goal of limiting situations where a toy may be banned to those ""obviously dangerous in normal use."" This harmonizing objective is designed to address significant differences in national rules that have hampered trade within the internal market. As illustrated in 'The Queen, on the application of: Swedish Match AB and Swedish Match UK Ltd v Secretary of State for Health', the EU has the authority to take appropriate measures regarding product marketing, which may include requiring authorization or even prohibiting marketing. In this context, a maximum harmonization directive sets the permissible boundaries for national regulation.

Swedish law, however, prohibits ""immoral or inappropriate toys,"" specifically including toy guns, a ban that has been upheld for over 30 years. This national prohibition directly conflicts with the Directive's more restrictive criterion for banning toys. The sale of 'Bang' in Sweden, therefore, is permitted under the Directive's standard but prohibited under Swedish law.

Such a national prohibition, even if it does not absolutely preclude the importation of products, can nonetheless make their marketing more difficult and thus impede, at least indirectly, trade between Member States. This principle was highlighted in 'Proceedings for compulsory reconstruction against Smanor SA.', which referenced the judgment in 'Fietje'. The Swedish ban on toy guns, by making the marketing of a product like 'Bang' impossible, could be seen as an impediment to trade, contrary to the Directive's goal of facilitating the internal market. While 'Criminal proceedings against Gunnar Nilsson, Per Olov Hagelgren and Solweig Arrborn' suggests that national rules applying without distinction as to origin may not fall within the scope of Article 30 (now Article 34 TFEU), this typically applies to selling arrangements. A product ban, even if non-discriminatory, can still constitute a measure equivalent to a quantitative restriction if it impedes market access, and the Directive specifically aims to harmonize permissible product requirements to prevent such impediments.

Furthermore, the context provides for the concept of a ""disguised restriction on trade between Member States."" While discussed in 'Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG v Centrafarm Vertriebsgesellschaft Pharmazeutischer Erzeugnisse mbH.' and reiterated in 'Boehringer Ingelheim KG... v Swingward Ltd and Dowelhurst Ltd.' in the context of trademark rights and repackaging, this principle generally applies where the exercise of a right or the application of a national measure, even if seemingly neutral, effectively restricts trade. Sweden's continued prohibition, despite the existence of a harmonizing Directive that sets a narrower scope for bans, could be argued to constitute such a disguised restriction by frustrating the Directive's aim of facilitating free movement of toys that meet the EU standard.

In conclusion, the provided context clearly establishes a conflict between the Swedish national law and the Safe Toys Directive, highlighting how the national prohibition impedes trade contrary to EU principles and the Directive's objectives. The Directive, as a maximum harmonization act, defines the permissible scope of national bans, which the Swedish law exceeds. Big Fun can, therefore, argue that the Swedish law is incompatible with the principles and objectives of the Safe Toys Directive, which aims to limit such prohibitions and facilitate trade. However, the provided context does not offer explicit legal principles, such as the direct effect of directives or the supremacy of EU law, which would enable Big Fun to definitively compel a national court to disapply the unimplemented Swedish law or directly rely on the Directive in a dispute against a private party. The context primarily outlines the incompatibility of national measures with EU trade principles when a harmonizing directive is in place.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","Here are the definitions and explanations of the requested EU law terms and concepts, based solely on the provided context:

**a) Special legislative procedure**

The provided context does not explicitly define ""special legislative procedure."" However, it clarifies the fundamental relationship between the legal basis of a measure and the procedure to be followed for its adoption. According to settled case-law, as highlighted in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"", the legal basis of a measure inherently determines the procedure that must be followed to adopt that measure. This principle is further emphasized by the Court's agreement with the Council's argument in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"", stating that procedures do not define the legal basis, but rather the legal basis dictates the procedures. Exceptionally, when a measure simultaneously pursues a number of objectives or has several inseparably linked components, and various Treaty provisions are therefore applicable, the Court has held, as seen in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"", that such a measure may be founded on multiple corresponding legal bases.

**b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs)**

Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs) refer to all legislation enacted by Member States that is capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade. This definition is a cornerstone of settled case-law, as established in ""Dassonville"" and consistently reaffirmed in cases such as ""Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany"" and ""Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Austria"" with regard to Article 28 EC. The prohibition on such measures also applies under Article 30 of the Treaty, as noted in ""Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany"", drawing on the same foundational principle from ""Dassonville"" and also referencing ""Commission v Denmark"".

However, national legislation that constitutes a measure having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions can be justified. As clarified in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands"", referencing ""Commission v Italy"" and ""Commission v Finland"", such justification can be based on one of the grounds of public interest laid down in Article 30 EC or by imperative requirements.

**e) Proportionality**

Proportionality is a crucial legal principle that applies when national legislation constituting a measure having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions is sought to be justified. As articulated in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands"", and supported by cases such as ""Radiosistemi"" and ""ATRAL"", for a national provision to be considered justified, it must meet two conditions: first, it must be appropriate for securing the attainment of the objective pursued; and second, it must not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain that objective. This ensures that any permissible restriction on intra-Community trade is strictly limited to what is essential to achieve a legitimate aim.","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law.","EU law establishes certain principles regarding the rights of EU citizens to move and reside freely within Member States, as well as rules against discrimination on grounds of nationality in employment.

a) Regarding Cynthia's residence permit and her status as an ""EU worker"":
Based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the Belgian authorities' assessment that Cynthia can no longer be considered an ""EU worker"" due to her reduced working hours is in accordance with EU law. While the case of 'Mouvement contre le racisme, l'antisémitisme et la xénophobie ASBL (MRAX) v Belgian State' confirms that Member States are obliged to grant the right of residence to ""workers"" who can produce a valid identity card or passport, regardless of their entry document (as also held in 'Giagounidis'), the provided information does not define what constitutes a ""worker"" in terms of minimum hours or type of employment for the purpose of maintaining such status for an EU national already residing in a host Member State. The 'MRAX' case primarily addresses conditions for issuing residence permits, particularly concerning the irrelevance of an expired visa for third-country nationals married to EU citizens, and the general obligation to grant residence to workers. Therefore, the specific impact of Cynthia's change in employment on her ""EU worker"" status, and consequently her residence permit, cannot be assessed from the given context.

b) Regarding the job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media:
The rejection of Cynthia's application for a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media on the sole ground that she is not a Belgian citizen *could* be in accordance with EU law, provided the position falls within a specific exception. As established in 'Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon', Member States are allowed to restrict admission of foreign nationals to certain positions in the public service. This exception applies to jobs that ""presume on the part of those occupying them the existence of a special relationship of allegiance to the State and reciprocity of rights and duties which form the foundation of the bond of nationality."" While the context does not specify whether a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media meets these strict criteria, the principle allows for such nationality-based restrictions for particular public service roles. However, once a worker is admitted into the public service, they cannot be disentitled from other relevant provisions of EU law concerning workers.

c) Regarding the job at a private academy:
The rejection of Cynthia's application for a job at a private academy based on her nationality is generally not in accordance with EU law. The principle prohibiting discrimination on grounds of nationality is fundamental, as illustrated by 'Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium', which states that restrictions constituting discrimination on grounds of nationality are prohibited. The context does not provide any exceptions to this principle for private sector employment based on nationality. Therefore, rejecting her application solely because she is not a Belgian citizen would likely constitute prohibited discrimination.

However, concerning the linguistic requirements, the provided context does not offer any information or legal principles regarding the legality of linguistic requirements for employment within the EU. While the recruiters' stated reason for requiring advanced levels of other EU languages (to teach exchange students in their native languages) might appear to be a legitimate aim, the provided case law does not allow for an assessment of whether this specific requirement is proportionate or otherwise permissible under EU law. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the rejection based on linguistic requirements is in accordance with EU law based solely on the given information.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","As a judge at the local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough, I must thoroughly address the EU law-related issues. The core of the dispute revolves around the conflict between the national 1948 Law on Public Safety and the EU Safe Building Directive, particularly Article 20 thereof.

First, it is clear that Fantasia, as a Member State, was obliged to implement the Safe Building Directive. The Directive was adopted in May 2015, entered into force on June 1, 2015, and required Member States to comply by December 31, 2016. Fantasia implemented parts of the Directive by adopting the 2016 Construction Act on June 1, 2016, which reproduced Articles 5-15. However, Fantasia failed to make any changes to the 1948 Law on Public Safety, specifically Paragraph 138, which mandates shelters. This failure to repeal or amend conflicting national legislation constitutes a failure by the Member State to fulfill its obligations under EU law. This principle is underscored by cases such as ""Georgios Agorastoudis and Others"", which, in referencing ""Commission v Belgium"", highlights that a Member State fails to fulfill its obligations when it does not provide the protection or adhere to the requirements envisaged by a directive. From the deadline for implementation, and certainly by January 1, 2019, the meaning of the Directive's provisions, including Article 20, should have been clear.

The Safe Building Directive aims to harmonize building standards in the Member States to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Crucially, Article 20 states, ""The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15."" Articles 5-15 establish detailed meanings of good building practices but do not mention shelters.

Big Money argues that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and that it concerns the separate issue of public safety, thus unaffected by the Directive. However, the principle of supremacy of EU law dictates that where national law conflicts with EU law, EU law must prevail. The national court is obliged to set aside any national provision that is contrary to EU law. The requirement for a shelter, even if framed as a public safety measure, is undeniably a ""requirement on construction work and good building practices."" Given the Directive's aim of harmonization and the explicit prohibition in Article 20 against ""any further requirements"" beyond those specified, the Directive appears to have fully harmonized the field, leaving no room for Member States to impose additional burdens, even for public safety reasons, unless the Directive itself provides for such exceptions, which it does not in the provided context. Therefore, the 1948 Law, Paragraph 138, directly conflicts with Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive.

Good Enough's claim that Paragraph 138 must be set aside is valid. Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive appears to be clear, precise, and unconditional, meaning it can be relied upon by individuals in national courts. Even if direct effect against a private party (horizontal direct effect) were debated in this context, the fundamental obligation of the national court is to ensure the full effectiveness of EU law. This requires disapplying national provisions that obstruct the application of a clear and unconditional directive provision, especially where the Member State has failed to transpose it correctly. The failure of Fantasia to repeal the conflicting 1948 Law does not diminish the rights that individuals derive from the Directive.

Regarding Big Money's argument that the 1948 Law was still in effect and they relied upon it, the Court has, according to ""Belgische Staat v Cobelfret NV"", stated that it is only exceptionally that the opportunity to rely on an interpreted provision may be restricted based on the general principle of legal certainty. Such a limitation requires two essential criteria: that those concerned acted in good faith and that there is a risk of serious difficulties for legal relationships established in good faith. In this case, the issue is not a new interpretation of EU law but rather the direct conflict between existing national law and an EU directive that should have been correctly implemented. Furthermore, the context does not provide sufficient information to establish that Big Money acted in good faith reliance on a national law that should have been repealed, or that setting aside this specific paragraph would cause ""serious difficulties"" for legal relationships established in good faith in a way that would justify restricting the application of EU law. The primary obligation rests with the Member State to ensure its national law is compliant with EU law.

Therefore, I would resolve the EU law-related issues by concluding that Paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in this case. It directly contradicts Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive, which prohibits Member States from introducing further requirements on construction work and good building practices beyond what is laid down in the Directive. Fantasia's failure to repeal this conflicting national provision means that Good Enough can rely on the supremacy of EU law and the clear prohibition in Article 20. Consequently, Good Enough is not in breach of contract due to the absence of a shelter as required by the 1948 Law.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","Here are the definitions and explanations of the EU law terms and concepts based solely on the provided context:

a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP)
The legal basis of a measure determines the procedure to be followed in its adoption, as is apparent from settled case-law such as 'European Parliament v Council of the European Union'. It is not procedures that define the legal basis of a measure, but rather the legal basis that determines the procedures to be followed in adopting that measure, a principle also highlighted in 'European Parliament v Council of the European Union'. Furthermore, a legal basis may be designed to fill a gap where no specific provisions of the Treaty confer express or implied powers on the Community institutions, if such powers appear none the less necessary to enable the Community to carry out its functions with a view to attaining one of the objectives laid down by the Treaty, as referenced in 'European Parliament v Council of the European Union'.

b) State liability
The Court has established a system of rules concerning liability for legislative measures, particularly with regard to Article 215 of the Treaty. This system considers various factors, including the complexity of the situations to be regulated, difficulties in the application or interpretation of texts, and, more specifically, the margin of discretion available to the author of the act in question, as set out in 'Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others'. The EC Treaty also provides for a division of jurisdiction between the Community Courts and the national courts for judicial proceedings brought against the Community where its liability for damage is at issue, as affirmed in 'European Commission v Systran SA and Systran Luxembourg SA'. Moreover, while a different system of legal remedies, including rules governing non-contractual liability, could be envisaged, any reform of the system currently in force would be for the Member States to undertake in accordance with Article 48 EU, as indicated in 'Gestoras Pro Amnistía, Juan Mari Olano Olano and Julen Zelarain Errasti v Council of the European Union.'.

c) The preliminary ruling procedure

d) Indirect effect

e) Subsidiarity","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,
"Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B.

**A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen.**

**A.i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law?**

The Italian company's decision to deny Anna employment based on her not being an Italian citizen is not in conformity with EU law. EU law principles oppose measures that discriminate against nationals of other Member States. While the context does not explicitly define a general principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, it provides strong indications that such a measure is problematic.

According to 'Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic' (re: discrimination based on residence), a measure that draws a distinction based on residence is liable to disadvantage nationals of other Member States, as non-residents are typically foreigners. This case, referencing 'Ciola', highlights that it is immaterial whether such a measure also affects nationals of the State in question who reside in other parts of the national territory. Furthermore, for a measure to be considered discriminatory, it is not necessary for it to exclusively benefit all nationals of the State in question or to disadvantage *only* nationals of other Member States; it is sufficient if it puts nationals of other Member States at a disadvantage, as clarified in 'Angonese'. In Anna's case, the direct denial of employment based on her Swedish nationality constitutes a direct disadvantage for a national of another Member State, which is contrary to the spirit of the principles outlined regarding discrimination against non-nationals.

Additionally, the context of 'Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic' (re: transport consultant) illustrates how a condition requiring residence for nationals of other Member States wishing to pursue an activity directly negates the freedom to provide services, making it impossible for persons established in other Member States to offer services. This, referencing 'Commission v Belgium', demonstrates the general EU law aversion to restrictions that impede economic activity based on nationality or residence for citizens from other Member States.

Regarding potential justifications, the provided context states that the apprehension of internal difficulties cannot justify a Member State's failure to comply with its obligations under Community law, as established in cases such as 'Commission v Portugal', 'Italy v Commission', and 'Commission v Spain'. No other justification for such a direct discriminatory measure is provided in the context that would render it compatible with EU law.

**A.ii) What remedies might be available to her?**

The provided context primarily focuses on infringement proceedings brought by the European Commission against Member States for failing to fulfil their obligations under EU law. It discusses how the Court (referring to the Court of Justice of the European Union) determines such failures based on the situation prevailing at the end of the reasoned opinion period, as seen in 'Commission v Portugal' and 'Commission v Austria'. However, the context does not provide information regarding specific remedies available to individuals like Anna, nor does it describe whether she can initiate court proceedings against the decision in national or EU courts or under what specific legal authority such individual actions might be brought.

**B. Juan is Spanish and lives in Madrid with his Argentine wife Carmen. The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen.**

**B.i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not?**

The Portuguese authority's decision to deny Carmen a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen is not in conformity with EU law. According to 'Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Spain', the right of entry into the territory of a Member State granted to a third-country national who is the spouse of a national of a Member State derives solely from the family relationship. This means that Carmen's right to reside in Portugal stems from her marriage to Juan, a Spanish citizen exercising his right to free movement within the EU.

The issuance of a residence permit to a third-country national who is the spouse of an EU national is not considered a measure that creates rights. Instead, it is regarded as a measure by a Member State that serves to prove the individual's existing position under Community law, as clarified in 'MRAX'. Therefore, denying Carmen a residence permit based on her non-Union citizenship status contradicts the principle that her right to reside is inherent in her spousal relationship with an EU citizen.

Furthermore, if the Portuguese authorities were to attempt to justify this denial, the principle established in 'Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities' (re: internal difficulties) would apply. This case law, referencing 'Commission v Portugal', 'Italy v Commission', and 'Commission v Spain', states that the apprehension of internal difficulties cannot justify a Member State's failure to comply with its obligations under Community law.

**B.ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation?**

If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits in such circumstances, the European Commission can take action at the EU level to remedy the situation. The context indicates that the Commission is responsible for determining whether a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under EU law.

The Commission can initiate infringement proceedings against Portugal. As stated in 'Commission of the European Communities v Portuguese Republic' (re: failure to fulfil obligations timing) and reiterated in 'Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic' (re: failure to fulfil obligations timing - repetition), the question of whether a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations is determined by reference to the situation prevailing in that Member State at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion. The Court (referring to the Court of Justice of the European Union) cannot take into account any subsequent changes. Therefore, if the Commission finds that Portugal is routinely failing to comply with its obligations regarding the residence rights of third-country national spouses of EU citizens, it can bring a court proceeding against Portugal before the Court of Justice of the European Union to declare that Portugal has failed to fulfil its obligations.","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","If the European Union suspects that Italy is breaching Union law by not sending its latest report, formal action can be taken. As demonstrated in cases such as ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic,"" the Commission is empowered to initiate proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union. In such a proceeding, it is incumbent upon the Commission to prove the alleged failure by the Member State to fulfil its obligations. The Commission must place before the Court the information needed to enable it to determine whether the obligation has not been fulfilled, as seen in ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"" regarding a failure to comply with a directive. Thus, the formal action involves the Commission bringing the matter before the Court of Justice to obtain a ruling on whether Italy has indeed failed to comply with its Union law obligations.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,
"1. Present the decision of the case. This presentation should include, in your own words (only highlighting text in the judgment won't give points), a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","The provided context outlines several key procedural principles established and reaffirmed by the Court of Justice of the European Union across multiple judgments, rather than detailing the full decision of a single case. These principles primarily concern the requirements for administrative decisions to be adequately reasoned and for applications and appeals submitted to the EU courts to be sufficiently clear and precise.

**1. Presentation of the Decision**

**a) Summary of Relevant Facts, Parties, and Dispute:**
The context does not provide specific facts or detailed disputes for each case. Instead, it presents excerpts from judgments that articulate general legal principles. The parties involved in these cases typically include the Commission of the European Communities, often acting as applicant against Member States such as Ireland, Finland, Italy, or France, or against other EU institutions like the European Parliament and Council of the European Union. In other instances, cases involve individuals, such as Frédéric Daffix or Z, or private entities like Scott SA. The underlying disputes are not described, but the judgments clarify procedural requirements that apply to various types of legal actions or administrative decisions.

**b) Procedures and Courts:**
The excerpts refer to proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union, with some mention of the Court of First Instance (now the General Court). The discussions revolve around the formal requirements for bringing actions before these courts, specifically concerning applications and appeals, and the standards for the reasoning of decisions that may be subject to judicial review. The procedures implicitly involve judicial review of institutional acts or actions for failure to fulfil obligations by Member States, where the clarity of pleadings and the transparency of decisions are paramount.

**c) Central Legal Issues Discussed by the Court of Justice:**
The central legal issues addressed by the Court of Justice in these judgments fall into two main categories:
Firstly, the requirement for a proper statement of reasons for decisions, particularly those adversely affecting a person. This is highlighted in ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"", where the Court considered whether a contested decision provided sufficient reasons (paragraphs 35 to 46). Similarly, in ""Commission of the European Communities v Département du Loiret and Scott SA"", the Court reaffirmed the settled case-law that the statement of reasons must clearly and unequivocally disclose the institution's reasoning (paragraph 43).
Secondly, the requirements for applications and appeals lodged with the EU courts. This issue is central to ""Commission of the European Communities v Ireland"" (paragraph 30), ""Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Finland"" (paragraph 22), ""Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union"" (paragraph 27), and ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"" (paragraph 103), all of which emphasize the need for clarity and precision in applications. The requirements for appeals are specifically addressed in ""Z v European Parliament"" (paragraph 33).

**d) Relevant Legal Rules (Provisions of EU Law):**
The judgments refer to several key legal provisions:
For the requirement to state reasons, Article 253 EC is cited in ""Commission of the European Communities v Département du Loiret and Scott SA"" (paragraph 43). This provision mandates that acts adopted by the EU institutions state the reasons on which they are based.
For the requirements of an application to the Court of Justice, Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice is consistently referenced across multiple cases, including ""Commission of the European Communities v Ireland"" (paragraph 30), ""Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Finland"" (paragraph 22), ""Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union"" (paragraph 27), and ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"" (paragraph 103).
For the requirements of an appeal, the first paragraph of Article 51 of the EC Statute of the Court of Justice and Article 112(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure are mentioned in ""Z v European Parliament"" (paragraph 33).

**e) How the Parties Argued and the Court of Justice Analysed:**
The provided context does not detail the specific arguments made by the parties in each case. Instead, it focuses on the Court of Justice's analysis and its consistent application of established case-law. The Court's analysis in these cases reiterates the importance of procedural clarity and precision. For instance, in ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"", the Court observed that the requirement for a statement of reasons is intended to allow the person concerned to ascertain the decision's foundation and enable the Court to review its legality (paragraph 32). In cases concerning applications, the Court consistently states that the application must be sufficiently clear and precise to enable the defendant to prepare a defence and for the Court to rule on the application without going ""ultra petita"" (beyond what is sought) or failing to rule on a complaint. The essential points of fact and law must be indicated coherently and intelligibly.

**f) Conclusion Regarding the Issues:**
The Court's conclusions across these judgments establish and reaffirm fundamental procedural principles. It consistently holds that decisions adversely affecting individuals must provide sufficient reasons, the adequacy of which depends on the circumstances of each case, including the content of the measure and the addressee's interest in explanations (""Commission of the European Communities v Département du Loiret and Scott SA"", paragraph 43). Furthermore, applications to the Court of Justice must clearly state the subject-matter and a summary of the pleas, with essential points of law and fact presented coherently and intelligibly, and the form of order sought set out unambiguously (""Commission of the European Communities v Ireland"", paragraph 30; ""Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Finland"", paragraph 22). Similarly, appeals must precisely indicate the contested elements of the judgment and the supporting legal arguments (""Z v European Parliament"", paragraph 33). These principles ensure the proper conduct of legal proceedings and the effective exercise of judicial review.

**2. Importance in the General Scheme of EU Law**

These cases collectively underscore the critical importance of procedural formality and transparency within the EU legal order. They highlight two fundamental pillars of EU administrative and judicial procedure: the duty to state reasons for administrative decisions and the strict requirements for initiating and conducting legal proceedings before the EU Courts.

The consistent emphasis on the requirement for a statement of reasons, as seen in ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"" and ""Commission of the European Communities v Département du Loiret and Scott SA"", is a cornerstone of the principle of good administration and the right to effective judicial protection. By obliging institutions to disclose their reasoning in a clear and unequivocal fashion, EU law ensures legal certainty and allows individuals to understand the basis for decisions affecting them. This transparency is crucial for enabling addressees to ascertain whether a decision is well-founded and to effectively challenge its legality before the courts. Furthermore, it provides the competent EU Court with the necessary information to exercise its power of review, ensuring that institutional acts are adopted in accordance with the law. The varied requirements for the level of detail, depending on the circumstances of each case as noted in ""Commission of the European Communities v Département du Loiret and Scott SA"" (paragraph 43), demonstrate a pragmatic approach to this principle while upholding its core objective.

Equally vital are the stringent requirements for applications and appeals, consistently reaffirmed across cases like ""Commission of the European Communities v Ireland"", ""Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Finland"", ""Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union"", and ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"". By requiring the subject-matter and pleas in law to be stated with sufficient clarity and precision (e.g., ""Commission of the European Communities v Ireland"", paragraph 30), the Court ensures a fair trial. A defendant must be able to understand the case against them to prepare an adequate defence. Moreover, these rules are essential for the efficient functioning of the Court itself, enabling it to rule on the application without exceeding the scope of the claims (ultra petita) or failing to address specific complaints. The requirement for essential points of fact and law to be indicated coherently and intelligibly (e.g., ""Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Finland"", paragraph 22) maintains the integrity and manageability of judicial proceedings. The specific rules for appeals, as outlined in ""Z v European Parliament"" (paragraph 33), similarly ensure that the appellate court can precisely identify the contested elements of a judgment and the legal arguments supporting the request to set it aside.

In the general scheme of EU law, these procedural principles are indispensable for upholding the rule of law and ensuring effective judicial protection. They are not merely technical formalities but fundamental safeguards that contribute to the legitimacy and effectiveness of the EU legal system. They ensure that both administrative action and judicial processes are transparent, predictable, and amenable to review, thereby reinforcing trust in the EU's governance and justice system. The consistent reiteration of these principles across various judgments highlights their settled nature and foundational importance in EU procedural law. The provided context, however, focuses exclusively on these procedural aspects and does not delve into areas of substantive EU law.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","The provided context does not describe the difference between an absolute and relative right, nor does it provide examples of each from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The Court has consistently held that fundamental rights form an integral part of the general principles of law, the observance of which it ensures. This principle is clearly articulated across numerous judgments, including ""Liselotte Hauer v Land Rheinland-Pfalz"", ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"", ""Bernard Connolly v Commission of the European Communities"", ""Yassin Abdullah Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council of the European Union and Commission of the European Communities"", ""Laserdisken ApS v Kulturministeriet"", ""Dieter Krombach v André Bamberski"", and ""Eugen Schmidberger, Internationale Transporte und Planzüge v Republik Österreich"". In safeguarding these rights, the Court draws inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, and measures incompatible with the fundamental rights recognized by those national constitutions are deemed unacceptable within the Community. Furthermore, international treaties for the protection of human rights, to which Member States have collaborated or are signatories, provide essential guidelines to be followed within the framework of Community law. The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) is explicitly stated to have special or particular significance in this regard, as noted in ""Dieter Krombach v André Bamberski"" and other cases. This conception was later recognized by the Joint Declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 5 April 1977, which recalled the Court's case-law and referred to rights guaranteed by national constitutions and the ECHR. However, the provided context does not offer reasons for the Court's adoption of this direction or discuss any prior hesitancy to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from Member State constitutional laws.

According to the consistent case-law, the Court ensures the observance of fundamental rights by drawing inspiration from two principal sources. Firstly, it draws from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as emphasized in ""Liselotte Hauer v Land Rheinland-Pfalz"" and ""Eugen Schmidberger, Internationale Transporte und Planzüge v Republik Österreich"". Secondly, guidelines are supplied by international treaties for the protection of human rights on which the Member States have collaborated or to which they are signatories. In this respect, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) holds special or particular significance, as affirmed in cases such as ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"" and ""Dieter Krombach v André Bamberski"". The Joint Declaration of 5 April 1977 also refers to these two categories of rights. The provided context does not identify a third principal source of EU fundamental rights in the nature of a ""bill of rights"", nor does it specify where these sources are stated in the treaties.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","The scenario concerning Maria, a Portuguese national residing in Italy, raises questions regarding the scope of free movement for workers under EU law, specifically Article 39 EC, and her right of residence.

**A) Is the decision to refuse Maria's residence in conformity with EU law?**

The decision's conformity with EU law hinges on whether Maria, despite reducing her hours to 15 per week, still qualifies as a ""worker"" within the meaning of EU law. The principle of freedom of movement for workers, enshrined in Article 39 EC, entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality regarding employment, remuneration, and other conditions of work, as established in ""Andrea Raccanelli v Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften eV."", referencing ""Angonese"".

The crucial aspect is the definition of a ""worker."" According to ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Denmark,"" a person who performs services for and under the direction of another in return for remuneration is considered a worker. More specifically, any person pursuing activities that are ""real and genuine,"" to the exclusion of those ""on such a small scale as to be regarded as purely marginal and ancillary,"" is entitled to freedom of movement as a worker. This definition is supported by the Court's rulings in ""Lawrie-Blum"" and ""Collins.""

Applying this to Maria's situation, the Italian authorities' refusal, based on her not being engaged in a ""gainful occupation"" because she only works 15 hours a week, depends on whether these hours are considered ""purely marginal and ancillary."" The provided context does not specify a minimum number of hours or remuneration level to avoid being deemed marginal. Therefore, if Maria's 15 hours of teaching at a primary school are deemed real and genuine activities rather than purely marginal, she would retain her status as an EU worker. The fact that an employee is placed at a disadvantage in regard to working conditions, such as the potential loss of residence rights, compared to colleagues residing in the country of their employer, has a direct effect on the exercise of their right to freedom of movement, as noted in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Denmark,"" referencing ""Ledoux.""

The right of residence for migrant workers is generally subject to the condition that the person remains a worker, as stated in ""Georgios Orfanopoulos and Others and Raffaele Oliveri v Land Baden-Württemberg,"" referencing ""Antonissen."" Consequently, if Maria's 15-hour work is indeed ""real and genuine"" and not ""purely marginal and ancillary,"" the Italian decision to refuse her residence on the grounds that she is not a privileged 'EU worker' would not be in conformity with EU law, as she would retain her worker status.

**B) Does Maria have any other option beyond being an 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy?**

Yes, Maria may have other options to reside in Italy beyond maintaining her status as an 'EU worker'. As highlighted in ""Georgios Orfanopoulos and Others and Raffaele Oliveri v Land Baden-Württemberg,"" referencing ""Antonissen,"" the right of residence for migrant workers is conditional on the person remaining a worker *or, where relevant, a person seeking employment*. This indicates that even if Maria's current 15-hour work were to be considered ""purely marginal and ancillary"" by the Italian authorities, she might still be able to reside in Italy if she can demonstrate that she is genuinely a person seeking employment. The context also broadly mentions the possibility of deriving a right to residence from ""other provisions of Community law,"" suggesting further avenues beyond worker or job-seeker status, though these are not elaborated upon in the provided information.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,
"Throughout the course you have been trained in reading and analysing the case law of the European Court of Justice. Below is a judgment of the European Court of Justice, C-561/19, Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA Your assignment: 1. Present the decision of the case (7 p.). This presentation should include, in your own words, a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","The provided context does not contain any information regarding the case of 'Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA' (C-561/19). Therefore, it is not possible to present a summary of its relevant facts, the parties involved, the nature of their dispute, the procedures that occurred in various courts, the central legal issues discussed by the Court of Justice, the specific legal rules or provisions of EU law applied, how the parties argued, or the Court of Justice's analysis and conclusion regarding the issues in that particular case.

However, the provided context does offer valuable insights into fundamental procedural principles governing the operation of EU law and the role of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). These principles are central to the general scheme of EU law and are crucial for understanding how the EU judicial system functions.

One prominent area illustrated by the context is the **preliminary ruling procedure** under Article 234 EC (now Article 267 TFEU), which establishes a cooperative relationship between the CJEU and national courts. According to settled case-law, as seen in 'Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA', 'Grundig Italiana SpA v Ministero delle Finanze', 'Teresa Cicala v Regione Siciliana', and 'Ministero dell'Industria, del Commercio e dell'Artigianato v Lucchini SpA', it is exclusively for the national court, which is responsible for the subsequent judicial decision in the dispute, to determine the necessity of a preliminary ruling and the relevance of the questions it submits to the CJEU. This determination is made in light of the specific circumstances of the case. Consequently, where the questions submitted by a national court concern the interpretation of Community (now Union) law, the CJEU is, in principle, bound to give a ruling. The case of 'Ministero dell'Industria, del Commercio e dell'Artigianato v Lucchini SpA' further underscores this by highlighting a clear separation of functions, where any assessment of the facts in a case remains a matter for the national court.

Another significant principle highlighted is the **duty to state reasons** for acts adopted by EU institutions, as required by Article 253 EC (now Article 296 TFEU). As established in cases such as 'Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities' and 'Italian Republic v Council of the European Union', the statement of reasons must be appropriate to the specific measure at issue. It must clearly and unequivocally disclose the reasoning followed by the institution that adopted the measure. This requirement serves a dual purpose: it enables the persons concerned to understand the reasons behind the measure and allows the competent Community (or Union) Court to exercise its power of review.

Furthermore, the context touches upon the **appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Justice**. In appeals from the Court of First Instance (now the General Court), the Court of Justice has the power to review the legal classification of facts that have been found or appraised by the lower court, as well as the legal inferences drawn from those facts. As affirmed in 'European Parliament v Carlo Ripa di Meana, Leoluca Orlando and Gastone Parigi', such a classification is considered a question of law, which is subject to review by the Court of Justice on appeal.

In conclusion, while the specific details of 'Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA' cannot be discussed based on the provided context, the other cases supplied illustrate fundamental procedural aspects of EU law. These include the division of responsibilities in the preliminary ruling mechanism, the imperative for EU institutions to provide clear justifications for their actions, and the scope of the CJEU's appellate review, all of which are essential for upholding the rule of law and ensuring effective judicial protection within the European Union.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"The provided text does not define or explain ""indirect challenge of an EU act,"" ""national procedural autonomy,"" ""the principle of supremacy,"" ""non-legislative EU act,"" or ""field of application of EU fundamental rights.""  Therefore, I cannot answer your question using only the provided text.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","Big Fun's ability to rely on the Safe Toys Directive depends on whether Sweden's failure to implement the directive affects the application of EU law in this specific case.  While the directive aims to harmonize rules on toy production, marketing, and sale to facilitate trade between Member States, Sweden's non-implementation creates a conflict.  The directive's goal is to limit bans to situations where a toy is ""obviously dangerous in normal use,"" a standard stricter than Sweden's prohibition on toys imitating firearms.  

The case of ""The Queen, on the application of: Swedish Match AB and Swedish Match UK Ltd v Secretary of State for Health"" suggests that Member States may, under certain circumstances, prohibit the marketing of a product. However, the permissibility of such prohibitions must be assessed against the principles of free movement of goods.  The Swedish ban, while long-standing, may be challenged if it constitutes a disguised restriction on trade, as discussed in ""Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG v Centrafarm Vertriebsgesellschaft Pharmazeutischer Erzeugnisse mbH.""  The fact that the ""Bang"" is already in free circulation in another Member State (Denmark) and that its marketing is made more difficult by the Swedish ban is relevant, as highlighted in ""Proceedings for compulsory reconstruction against Smanor SA.""  A complete prohibition may be considered an obstacle to trade, even indirectly, as indicated in ""Proceedings for compulsory reconstruction against Smanor SA.""

The question of whether the Swedish ban constitutes a disproportionate restriction on trade in light of the Safe Toys Directive's stricter criteria remains.  The judgment in ""Boehringer Ingelheim KG, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG, Glaxo Group Ltd, The Wellcome Foundation Ltd, SmithKline Beecham plc, Beecham Group plc, SmithKline & French Laboratories Ltd and Eli Lilly and Co. v Swingward Ltd and Dowelhurst Ltd"" indicates that a derogation from free movement based on trademark rights is not acceptable if it constitutes a disguised restriction on trade.  Similarly, the Swedish ban, even if based on national legislation, might be considered a disguised restriction if it disproportionately impacts the free movement of goods.  The case of ""Criminal proceedings against Gunnar Nilsson, Per Olov Hagelgren and Solweig Arrborn"" shows that national rules applying without distinction to the origin of products don't automatically fall within the scope of restrictions on free movement. However, this case does not directly address a situation where the national rule is directly contrary to a non-implemented EU directive.  The case of ""Adam Opel AG v Autec AG"" is not directly relevant to this situation.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","a) **Special legislative procedure:**  The legal basis of a measure determines the procedure for its adoption.  This is established case law, as seen in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union,"" which states that the legal basis defines the procedure, not vice versa.  A measure with multiple, inseparably linked objectives may exceptionally require multiple legal bases, as per ""Commission v Council"".

b) **Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs):**  Article 28 EC (and Article 30 of the Treaty, according to ""Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany"") prohibits MEQRs.  Case law, notably ""Dassonville,"" defines MEQRs as any national legislation that hinders, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade.  This broad definition is further supported by cases like ""Deutscher Apothekerverband,"" ""Rosengren and Others,"" ""Commission v Netherlands,"" ""Ludwigs-Apotheke,"" ""Commission v Denmark,"" and ""Commission v Austria.""  While MEQRs are generally prohibited, they can be justified on grounds of public interest under Article 30 EC or by imperative requirements, as outlined in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands,"" provided they are appropriate and necessary (""Commission v Italy,"" ""Commission v Finland,"" ""Radiosistemi,"" and ""ATRAL"").

c) The provided text does not define or explain ""concerted practices.""

d) **Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings:** The provided text does not explicitly define ""enforcement actions/infringement proceedings,"" but the cases involving the Commission ("" Commissionv Greece,"" ""Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany,"" ""Commission v Netherlands,"" ""Commission v Italy,"" ""Commission v Finland,""  ""Commission v Denmark,"" and ""Commission v Austria"") suggest that the Commission plays a role in initiating legal actions against Member States for non-compliance with EU law.

e) **Proportionality:**  A national provision justifying an MEQR must be appropriate for achieving its objective and not exceed what is necessary, according to ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands,"" referencing ""Radiosistemi"" and ""ATRAL.""","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law.","a)  Whether Belgium's refusal to renew Cynthia's residence permit is in accordance with EU law depends on the interpretation of ""worker"" under EU law.  The case of *MRAX v Belgian State* clarifies that a Member State cannot refuse a residence permit based solely on an expired visa, provided the individual entered lawfully. While the case does not directly address a change in employment status, the principle of free movement of workers, as established in directives such as Directive 68/360 and Directive 73/148, suggests that a reduction in working hours from full-time to part-time employment might not automatically disqualify Cynthia as a ""worker"" if she still maintains a genuine and effective economic activity.  Further information is needed to determine if her current 10-hour-a-week position constitutes a genuine economic activity.

b)  The Belgian authorities' refusal to employ Cynthia at the Ministry of Higher Education based solely on her non-Belgian citizenship is likely not in accordance with EU law.  *Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon* indicates that while Member States can restrict admission to certain public service positions requiring a special relationship of allegiance, this restriction does not apply once a worker is already admitted to the public service.  This suggests that if Cynthia had already been employed in the Belgian public service, the refusal would be unlawful. However, this case does not directly address the initial application to the public service, so additional information is needed to definitively determine whether the rejection is unlawful.

c) The rejection of Cynthia's application at the private academy due to her non-Belgian citizenship and non-compliance with linguistic requirements requires careful consideration.  *Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium* establishes that discrimination on grounds of nationality is prohibited under Article 7 of the Treaty.  However, *Raymond Vander Elst v Office des Migrations Internationales* suggests that national rules may apply to employment relationships, provided there is no substantial risk of worker exploitation or distortion of competition. While requiring advanced levels of other EU languages might be justifiable in a private sector job, the rejection based solely on her non-Belgian citizenship would constitute unlawful discrimination.  The justification based on linguistic requirements needs further examination to determine if it is proportionate and non-discriminatory.  The case *Commission of the European Communities v Grand Duchy of Luxemburg* suggests that such requirements must be balanced against the protections already afforded to workers by their employer's home state.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","This case involves interpreting the interaction between EU law, specifically the Safe Building Directive of 2015, and national law, the 1948 Law on Public Safety in Fantasia.  The core issue is whether paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law, requiring shelters in buildings accommodating more than 10 people, is valid in light of the Safe Building Directive and its implementation in Fantasia.

The Safe Building Directive, aiming to harmonize building standards within the EU, prohibits Member States from introducing requirements beyond those specified in Articles 5-15 (Article 20).  Fantasia implemented the Directive by adopting the 2016 Construction Act, mirroring Articles 5-15. However, the 1948 Law on Public Safety, containing paragraph 138's shelter requirement, remains in force.  Good Enough argues that this is a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive.

The case-law offers guidance. In “Commission v Belgium”, the Court held that a Member State failed to fulfill its obligations by not providing worker protection as envisaged by a Directive.  This suggests that Fantasia's failure to repeal conflicting national provisions might be a breach of its obligations under the Safe Building Directive. However, the present case differs as it does not directly concern the protection of workers. The relevance of the directive's implementation date (December 31, 2016) is also unclear based solely on the provided information.

The principle of legal certainty, as discussed in “Belgische Staat v Cobelfret NV”, suggests that the Court may restrict reliance on a provision interpreted to question legal relationships established in good faith.  This principle would need to be considered in the context of the contract between Good Enough and Big Money, which specified adherence to national legislation in force on January 1, 2019.  The 1948 Law was in effect on that date, suggesting that Good Enough's failure to comply with paragraph 138 could potentially constitute a breach of contract.

Furthermore, the reasoning in cases like “Kingdom of Spain v Commission of the European Communities” and “Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities” regarding the adequacy of reasons in decisions on the clearance of accounts, is not directly applicable to this contractual dispute. Similarly, the case law in “Jobra Vermögensverwaltungs-Gesellschaft mbH v Finanzamt Amstetten Melk Scheibbs” concerning the balanced allocation of taxing power between Member States is irrelevant to the present case.  Finally, the specific circumstances of “Georgios Agorastoudis and Others” concerning collective redundancies are also not directly applicable.

In conclusion, while the Safe Building Directive likely intended to preempt national regulations like paragraph 138, the contract between Good Enough and Big Money explicitly references the 1948 Law as in effect on January 1, 2019.  Whether Fantasia’s failure to repeal paragraph 138 constitutes a breach of EU law is not definitively answered by the provided case law, but the principle of legal certainty from “Belgische Staat v Cobelfret NV” must be considered.  The court must weigh the potential breach of EU law against the contractual obligations of Good Enough, considering the date of the contract and the relevant national law in effect at that time.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP):  The legal basis of a measure determines the procedure for its adoption.  This is established case law, as seen in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union,"" which clarifies that the procedures are defined by the legal basis, not vice versa.

b) State liability:  The system of rules regarding state liability, particularly concerning liability for legislative measures, considers factors such as the complexity of situations, difficulties in application or interpretation of texts, and the margin of discretion available to the act's author. This is explained in ""Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others.""  Furthermore, the jurisdiction of the Court in relation to state liability is less extensive under certain Treaty titles (Title V and VI of the Treaty on European Union) than under others, as noted in ""Gestoras Pro Amnistía, Juan Mari Olano Olano and Julen Zelarain Errasti v Council of the European Union.""  The Treaty may establish a system of legal remedies, including rules governing non-contractual liability, but any reform of this system would fall to Member States under Article 48 EU.  The concept of ""exercise of official authority"" within the context of state liability, particularly concerning freedom of establishment, must consider the limits imposed by EU law to ensure the Treaty's effectiveness is not undermined by unilateral Member State provisions, as shown in ""European Commission v Republic of Austria.""  Finally, jurisdiction over actions against the Community concerning its liability for damage is divided between Community Courts and national courts, as per ""European Commission v Systran SA and Systran Luxembourg SA.""

c) The preliminary ruling procedure: This question cannot be answered from the given source.

d) Indirect effect: This question cannot be answered from the given source.

e) Subsidiarity:  The concept of subsidiarity, as it relates to the legal basis of a measure, is touched upon in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union.""  A legal basis may be necessary to enable the Community to fulfill its functions in achieving Treaty objectives, particularly when no specific Treaty provisions grant express or implied powers to act.  This is further supported by ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union,"" referencing Opinion 2/94 and Joined Cases C‑402/05 P and C‑415/05 P Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation  v Council and Commission.","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,
"Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B. Juan is Spanish and lives in Madrid with his Argentine wife Carmen. The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not? (Reason as with A(i) above), yet use question B facts.) ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation? (Include whether it can bring a court proceeding against Portugal.) Your assignment: Answer each sub-question from a EU law perspective. Support your answers by referring at every opportunity during your answers when relevant references are made of sources of EU law. Make clear which sub-question you are answering. Where appropriate provide specific examples (like in math class), not simply an unexplained answer. In other words describe several steps applying the law you have learned to these facts and demonstrating your understanding of how they fit within the broader context of the EU legal system functions.","A(i): The Italian public school's decision denying Anna employment based solely on her Swedish nationality is likely not in conformity with EU law.  This appears to violate the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, a cornerstone of EU law relating to the free movement of workers.  The case of *“Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic.”* highlights that a measure drawing a distinction based on residence, which disproportionately affects non-nationals, is discriminatory.  While the provided text does not detail the specific grounds for the school's decision, if it is based solely on Anna's nationality, it would be considered discriminatory, similar to the situation in *“Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic.”*  There is no information in the provided text that would justify such discrimination based on public interest.  The case of *“Commission v Spain”* indicates that any obstacle to the free movement of services must be justified by a public interest not already safeguarded by the rules of the Member State where the service provider is established.


A(ii):  The provided text does not specify the remedies available to Anna.


B(i): The Portuguese authority's refusal to grant Carmen a residence permit solely because she is not a Union citizen is likely not in conformity with EU law.  *“Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Spain.”* states that the right of entry for a third-country national married to an EU citizen derives from the family relationship.  The issuance of a residence permit is viewed as a measure to prove the third-country national's status under EU law, not a measure granting rights.  Therefore, denying Carmen a residence permit based solely on her nationality, while her husband is an EU citizen, would appear to be a breach of EU law on the free movement of persons.


B(ii): If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits in situations like Carmen's, the European Commission could bring a court proceeding against Portugal under EU law.  *“Commission of the European Communities v Portuguese Republic.”* and *“Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic.”* establish that the Court will assess the situation at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion, and subsequent changes will not be considered.  The Commission can initiate infringement proceedings against Portugal for failing to fulfill its obligations under EU law, similar to the actions taken in the cases provided.  The outcome would depend on the specific facts and Portugal's arguments, but the principle of free movement of persons, as established in case law, would be central to the case.","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","1) The provided text does not specify which article in the Treaties mandates Member States to fulfill their EU obligations.


2)  Based on the provided text, if the European Union suspects Italy is breaching Union law by failing to submit its required report under Directive (EU) 2016/2284,  the EU can take formal action.  The text mentions that the Commission must prove the allegation of non-compliance and provide the Court with sufficient information to determine whether an obligation has been breached, as seen in ""Commission v Italy [2001] ECR I-4195, paragraph 27"".  The text demonstrates that the Commission initiates proceedings against a Member State for failure to fulfill obligations, as seen in multiple cases such as ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic.""


3) If the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy failed to fulfill an obligation under the Treaties and Italy subsequently refuses to comply with the judgment, the text does not detail the consequences.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,
"1. Present the decision of the case. This presentation should include, in your own words (only highlighting text in the judgment won't give points), a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) 2.

Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","The provided text does not contain a single case's decision with all the requested elements (facts, procedures, legal issues, rules, arguments, analysis, and conclusion).  Instead, it presents excerpts from multiple cases dealing with procedural aspects of EU law, primarily concerning the requirements for statements of reasons in decisions and applications before the Court of Justice.

Several cases address the necessity of a clear and precise statement of reasons in decisions impacting individuals.  In “Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix,” the Court examined whether a decision adequately stated its reasons, referencing prior case law establishing that the statement must allow the affected individual to assess the decision's validity and permit judicial review (“Michel v Parliament,” “Lux v Court of Auditors,” and “Pérez-Mínguez Casariego v Commission”).  The specific facts of Daffix and the Court's ultimate conclusion on the adequacy of the statement of reasons are not provided.

Other cases, including “Commission of the European Communities v Ireland,” “Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Finland,” “Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union,” and “Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic,” focus on the requirements for applications before the Court of Justice under Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure. These cases consistently emphasize that applications must clearly state the subject matter and pleas in law, enabling the defendant to prepare its defense and the Court to rule effectively.  The cases highlight the need for coherent and intelligible presentation of facts and law, preventing the Court from ruling *ultra petita* or failing to address complaints.  Relevant prior case law cited includes “Italy v Commission,” “Commission v Spain,” “Ireland v Commission,” “Commission v France,” and “Commission v Finland.”  Again, the specific facts and outcomes of these cases are not detailed.

Finally, “Commission of the European Communities v Département du Loiret and Scott SA” discusses the statement of reasons requirement under Article 253 EC, emphasizing that the reasoning must be clear and unequivocal, allowing affected parties to understand the reasons and the Court to review the decision. The Court notes the requirements depend on the circumstances, including the content of the measure, the reasons given, and the interests of those affected.  “Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France” and “Bertelsmann and Sony Corporation of America v Impala” are cited as relevant precedents.  The specific facts and conclusion of this case are also absent.  Similarly, “Z v European Parliament” addresses the requirements for appeals, citing “Bernardi v Parliament,” “Smanor and Others v Commission,” and “Lucaccioni v Commission” as precedents, but without providing the specific facts or outcome.

In summary, the provided text illustrates the importance of clear and precise legal argumentation and reasoning in EU legal proceedings.  It emphasizes the need for both applicants and decision-making bodies to meet specific procedural requirements to ensure effective judicial review and avoid procedural irregularities. However, the lack of complete case details prevents a full analysis of any single case's decision.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","a) The provided text does not define or provide examples of absolute and relative rights from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Therefore, I cannot answer this question using only the provided information.


b) The provided text does not explicitly state the reasons why the CJEU in *Internationale Handelsgesellschaft* shifted towards acknowledging fundamental rights stemming from Member State constitutional laws after previous hesitancy. However,  cases such as *Liselotte Hauer v Land Rheinland-Pfalz*, *European Parliament v Council of the European Union*, *Bernard Connolly v Commission of the European Communities*, *Yassin Abdullah Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council of the European Union and Commission of the European Communities*, *Laserdisken ApS v Kulturministeriet*, *Dieter Krombach v André Bamberski*, and *Eugen Schmidberger, Internationale Transporte und Planzüge v Republik Österreich* all consistently affirm that fundamental rights are an integral part of the general principles of law, drawing inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to Member States and international human rights treaties.  This suggests a gradual evolution in the Court's approach, incorporating Member State constitutional traditions and international instruments into its interpretation of fundamental rights within the EU legal framework.


c) The provided text names three principal sources for EU fundamental rights:  the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, international treaties for the protection of human rights on which the Member States have collaborated or to which they are signatories (with the European Convention on Human Rights having special significance), and general principles of law. However, the text does not specify where in the treaties these sources are stated.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","A) The Italian authorities' decision is likely not in conformity with EU law.  While the definition of a 'worker' requires genuine and effective activity, excluding purely marginal and ancillary activities ('Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Denmark', referencing 'Lawrie-Blum' and 'Collins'),  it does not specify a minimum number of hours.  The fact that Maria initially held full-time employment as a science teacher in Italy strengthens her claim.  Even a reduction to 15 hours a week may still constitute a genuine and effective activity, depending on the context.  'Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Denmark' highlights that even a disadvantage in working conditions compared to colleagues can affect the exercise of the right to freedom of movement.  Furthermore,  'Commission of the European Communities v Portuguese Republic', referencing 'De Groot', establishes that a Member State of origin cannot obstruct its nationals from accepting employment in another Member State.  Therefore, Italy's refusal based solely on reduced working hours might be considered an obstruction.  The principle of non-discrimination based on nationality regarding employment, remuneration, and other conditions of work and employment, as established in 'Andrea Raccanelli v Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften eV', referencing 'Angonese', further supports Maria's claim.

B) Yes, Maria may have other options to reside in Italy beyond being classified as an EU worker.  While her right of residence as a migrant worker is conditional on remaining a worker or seeking employment ('Georgios Orfanopoulos and Others (C-482/01) and Raffaele Oliveri (C-493/01) v Land Baden-Württemberg', referencing 'Antonissen'),  the case law does not exclude the possibility of other grounds for residence under EU law.  The provided text does not detail these other possibilities.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,

However, these excerpts do not provide any information about the specific case you requested.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"a) **Indirect challenge of an EU act**: This refers to the practice of challenging an EU act through a national court, rather than directly challenging it in the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The national court will refer the case to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling, allowing the ECJ to interpret the EU act and provide guidance on its validity. This process is often used when a national court is faced with a question of EU law that it cannot resolve on its own.

b) **National procedural autonomy**: This principle allows Member States to choose their own procedures for the application of EU law within their national legal systems. It means that while Member States must apply EU law, they have the freedom to decide how to do so, as long as it does not contradict the principles of EU law. This principle is subject to the principle of supremacy of EU law.

c) **The principle of supremacy**: This principle, established in the case of Van Duyn (Case 41/74), states that EU law takes precedence over national law. When there is a conflict between EU law and national law, EU law must be applied. This principle ensures the uniform application of EU law across all Member States.

d) **Non-legislative EU act**: This refers to any act adopted by the EU institutions that is not a legislative act. Examples include regulations, directives, decisions, and recommendations. Non-legislative acts can have different legal effects, such as binding or non-binding, depending on their nature and the specific provisions of the EU treaties.

e) **Field of application of EU fundamental rights**: EU fundamental rights, as laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, apply to the EU's institutions and to Member States when they are implementing EU law. This means that the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter must be respected by the EU and its Member States in all areas where EU law applies. The field of application of EU fundamental rights is broader than the traditional fields of EU law, such as the internal market or competition law.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","In the given scenario, Big Fun, the Danish company, can potentially rely on the Safe Toys Directive to defend against Happy Times' lawsuit. The Safe Toys Directive is a maximum harmonization act that aims to create a common framework for the production, marketing, and sale of toys across the European Union. This directive was introduced to address the significant differences in national rules that have historically hindered trade in toys between Member States.

According to the directive, the production, marketing, or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is ""obviously dangerous in normal use."" This standard is more lenient than the Swedish law, which prohibits toys that are ""immoral or inappropriate,"" including those that imitate firearms. Since Sweden has not implemented the directive, its national law remains in place, but it is subject to the principles of EU law, including the free movement of goods.

In the context of the case, the 'Bang' toy gun, which shoots water, could potentially be considered ""obviously dangerous in normal use"" under the directive's standards. However, the Swedish court must consider whether the directive's provisions apply to the situation, despite Sweden's non-implementation.

The case law supports the idea that Member States cannot unilaterally impose restrictions on goods that are in free circulation within the EU, unless such restrictions are necessary to protect public health, safety, or the environment. In 'Commission v Greece', the Greek government's failure to implement the directive was found to be a violation of EU law. Similarly, in 'Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG v Centrafarm Vertriebsgesellschaft Pharmazeutischer Erzeugnisse mbH', the court held that a trade mark proprietor's opposition to repackaging could not be accepted if it constituted a disguised restriction on trade between Member States.

Therefore, Big Fun may argue that the Swedish law's prohibition of toys imitating firearms is a disguised restriction on trade, as it goes beyond the directive's standard of ""obviously dangerous in normal use."" The Swedish court would need to balance the national law's protection of public morality against the EU's goal of free movement of goods. If the court finds that the Swedish law's prohibition is not necessary to protect public health or safety, it could potentially rule in favor of Big Fun, allowing the sale of the 'Bang' toy in Sweden.

In conclusion, Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive to argue that the Swedish law's prohibition of toys imitating firearms is a disguised restriction on trade, and that the directive's more lenient standard should apply. The Swedish court will need to carefully consider the principles of EU law and the specific circumstances of the case to make a decision.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","**a) Special legislative procedure**
The special legislative procedure refers to the specific procedures that must be followed when adopting certain types of EU legislation. These procedures are laid out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and are designed to ensure a high level of democratic legitimacy and transparency. For instance, Article 218 TFEU outlines the ordinary legislative procedure, which involves the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The special legislative procedure is also mentioned in the context of the European Parliament's role in determining the legal basis of a measure (see European Parliament v Council of the European Union, paragraph 37).

**b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs)**
MEQRs are national measures that, despite not being quantitative restrictions, have an effect equivalent to quantitative restrictions on intra-Community trade. These measures are prohibited under Article 28 TFEU, which prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and exports between Member States. The prohibition applies to all legislation of Member States that is capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade (see Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany, paragraph 28; Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Austria, paragraph 81).

**c) Concerted practices**
Concerted practices refer to agreements or practices between undertakings that, without being formal agreements, have the same effect as an agreement. These practices can include, for example, the exchange of information, the coordination of market conduct, or the division of markets. Concerted practices are prohibited under Article 101 TFEU, which prohibits agreements that may affect trade between Member States and prevent, restrict, or distort competition. The Court has held that concerted practices can be established by a combination of factors, such as the existence of an agreement, the exchange of information, and the coordination of market conduct (see, e.g., Case C-18/78 Commission v Ahlström  [1978] ECR 1315).

**d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings**
Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are legal actions brought by the European Commission against Member States that are alleged to have failed to comply with their obligations under EU law. These proceedings are governed by Article 258 TFEU, which provides that the Commission may bring an action before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) against a Member State that has failed to comply with its obligations under the Treaties. The purpose of these proceedings is to ensure that Member States respect their obligations under EU law and to maintain the integrity of the EU legal order (see, e.g., Case C-192/01 Commission v Denmark  [2003] ECR I‑0000).

**e) Proportionality**
Proportionality is a legal principle that requires that a measure taken by a public authority must be proportionate to the aim pursued. In the context of EU law, the principle of proportionality is often applied to assess the validity of national measures that are alleged to be MEQRs. The national provision must be appropriate for securing the attainment of the objective pursued and not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain it (see, e.g., Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands, paragraph 75; Case C-270/02 Commission v Italy  [2004] ECR I‑1559, paragraph 21).","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law.","a) The Belgian authorities' decision to refuse to renew Cynthia's residence permit based on her reduced working hours is not in accordance with EU law. According to the case law in 'Mouvement contre le racisme, l'antisémitisme et la xénophobie ASBL (MRAX) v Belgian State', a Member State may not refuse to issue a residence permit to a third country national who is married to a national of a Member State and entered the territory lawfully, solely on the ground that their visa expired before they applied for a residence permit. Since Cynthia is married to a Belgian national and entered Belgium lawfully, the Belgian authorities cannot refuse to renew her residence permit based on the expiration of her visa. Moreover, the Belgian authorities cannot refuse to renew her residence permit based on her reduced working hours, as this would be a form of discrimination against EU workers, which is prohibited under Article 45 TFEU.

b) The Belgian authorities' decision to reject Cynthia's application for a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media based on her non-Belgian citizenship is not in accordance with EU law. According to the case law in 'Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon', a Member State cannot disentitle a worker, once admitted into the public service of a Member State, to the application of the provisions contained in Article 39(1) to (3) EC. Since Cynthia has been admitted into the Belgian public service as a chemistry lecturer, she should be entitled to apply for jobs within the public service, regardless of her citizenship. Furthermore, the Belgian authorities' decision to reject her application based on her non-Belgian citizenship constitutes discrimination on grounds of nationality, which is prohibited under Article 7 of the Treaty.

c) The Belgian authorities' decision to reject Cynthia's application for a job at a private academy based on her non-Belgian citizenship and linguistic requirements is not in accordance with EU law. According to the case law in 'Government of the French Community and Walloon Government v Flemish Government', the principle of citizenship of the Union does not extend the material scope of the Treaty to internal situations which have no link with Community law. Since Cynthia's application for a job at a private academy is an internal situation with no link to Community law, the Belgian authorities cannot discriminate against her based on her non-Belgian citizenship. Moreover, the Belgian authorities cannot require Cynthia to comply with linguistic requirements that are not necessary for the job, as this would be a form of discrimination against EU workers, which is prohibited under Article 45 TFEU.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","In resolving the EU law-related issues in the case between Big Money and Good Enough, I would focus on the principles of EU law, particularly those related to the harmonization of building standards and the primacy of EU law over national law. The Safe Building Directive (Directive 2015/2085) is a key piece of legislation that harmonizes building standards across the EU, aiming to facilitate trade in construction work. The directive explicitly states in Article 20 that Member States may not introduce any further requirements beyond what is laid down in Articles 5-15, which do not mention shelters.

Given that Fantasia implemented the Safe Building Directive on June 1, 2016, and the 2016 Construction Act reproduces Article 5-15 of the directive, it is clear that the directive has superseded any national laws that conflict with it. This is in line with the principle of primacy of EU law over national law, as established in the case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), such as in ""Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA"" (Case C-106/89).

Therefore, I would conclude that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety, which requires the construction of shelters, is no longer applicable in the context of the Safe Building Directive. Good Enough can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive to argue that they are not required to include a shelter in the building, as the directive does not impose this requirement.

However, it is essential to consider the principle of legal certainty and the good faith of the parties involved. The ECJ has held in ""Belgische Staat v Cobelfret NV"" (Case C-313/05) that the Court may exceptionally restrict the opportunity of relying on a provision that it has interpreted, provided that the parties acted in good faith and there is a risk of serious difficulties. In this case, Good Enough should have been aware of the national law requirements regarding shelters when they entered into the contract with Big Money. Therefore, while the Safe Building Directive may supersede the national law, Good Enough may not be able to rely on it as a defense if they acted in bad faith or if there is a risk of serious difficulties for Big Money.

In conclusion, I would rule in favor of Good Enough, as the Safe Building Directive supersedes the national law requirement for shelters. However, I would also consider the principle of legal certainty and the good faith of the parties involved before making a final decision.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP):
The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) is the standard procedure for the adoption of legislative acts in the European Union. It is established in Article 289 TFEU (formerly Article 251 TEC) and is also known as the co-decision procedure. This procedure involves both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, with the European Commission playing a key role in initiating and drafting legislative proposals. The European Parliament and the Council share legislative powers, and the Council's position must be approved by the Parliament. If the Parliament and the Council cannot agree, a conciliation committee is convened to find a compromise. The OLP ensures a balanced and democratic process for the adoption of EU legislation.

b) State liability:
State liability in EU law refers to the legal responsibility of Member States for damages caused by their actions or omissions that violate EU law. This concept is primarily governed by Article 288 TFEU (formerly Article 201 TEC), which provides that Member States are liable for damages caused by their non-compliance with EU law. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has developed the principles of state liability through various cases, such as Commission v Greece (Case C-6/90) and Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA (Case C-106/89). The CJEU has established that Member States can be held liable for damages if they fail to transpose EU directives into national law or if they act in a way that violates EU law.

c) The preliminary ruling procedure:
The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism established by Article 267 TFEU (formerly Article 234 EC) that allows national courts to refer questions of EU law to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. This procedure is designed to ensure the uniform application of EU law across the Member States. When a national court encounters a point of EU law that it considers uncertain or complex, it can refer the question to the CJEU. The CJEU provides an answer, which the national court must follow. This procedure is crucial for the effective application of EU law and helps to maintain legal certainty and uniformity.

d) Indirect effect:
The indirect effect of EU law refers to the way in which EU law can influence national legal systems, even when it has not been directly incorporated into national law. This principle is based on the idea that EU law has direct effect, meaning that individuals can rely on it directly in national courts. However, EU law can also have an indirect effect, influencing the interpretation and application of national law. This concept has been developed through various CJEU cases, such as Van Duyn v Home Office (Case 41/74) and Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA (Case C-106/89). The indirect effect of EU law ensures that national courts must interpret national law in a way that is consistent with EU law, even if there is no direct incorporation of EU law into national law.

e) Subsidiarity:
Subsidiarity is a principle of EU law that requires the EU to act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States or by regional or local authorities. This principle is enshrined in Article 5(3) TEU and is a fundamental aspect of the EU's institutional structure. The subsidiarity principle aims to ensure that the EU does not overstep its competences and that Member States retain as much autonomy as possible in areas where they can effectively act. The principle of subsidiarity is closely linked to the principle of proportionality, which requires that EU action must be proportionate to the objectives to be achieved. The CJEU has interpreted and applied the principle of subsidiarity in various cases, such as Opinion 2/94 and Case C-212/09 Commission v Council.","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,
"Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B. Juan is Spanish and lives in Madrid with his Argentine wife Carmen. The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not? (Reason as with A(i) above), yet use question B facts.) ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation? (Include whether it can bring a court proceeding against Portugal.) Your assignment: Answer each sub-question from a EU law perspective. Support your answers by referring at every opportunity during your answers when relevant references are made of sources of EU law. Make clear which sub-question you are answering. Where appropriate provide specific examples (like in math class), not simply an unexplained answer. In other words describe several steps applying the law you have learned to these facts and demonstrating your understanding of how they fit within the broader context of the EU legal system functions.","**A(i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law?**

The Italian public school's decision to deny Anna, a Swedish citizen, employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen may be in breach of EU law, particularly the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality. According to the case law, a distinction drawn on the basis of residence can be discriminatory, especially when it affects mainly foreigners (Case C-224/97 Ciola, paragraph 14). In this case, Anna's non-residency in Italy is the basis for discrimination, which could be seen as a violation of the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality.

Moreover, the decision may interfere with Anna's right to pursue her chosen profession, which is protected under EU law. The freedom to provide services, as established in the case law, is a fundamental right that should not be restricted without a valid justification (Case C-355/98 Commission v Belgium, paragraph 27). The Italian public school's decision to deny Anna employment based on her nationality could be seen as an unjustified interference with this right.

However, the decision may be justified if it serves a public interest that is not already safeguarded by the rules to which Anna is subject in her home Member State (Case C-514/03 Commission v Spain, paragraph 43). In this case, if the school's policy is to only employ Italian citizens to maintain a certain standard or cultural identity, this could potentially be a valid justification. However, this would need to be proven, and the school would have to show that this is the only way to achieve this public interest.

**A(ii) What remedies might be available to her?**

Anna could bring court proceedings against the decision. The first step would be to challenge the decision in the Italian courts. If the Italian courts uphold the decision, Anna could then bring a case before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) under Article 259 TFEU, which allows for the direct appeal of a judgment of a Member State's court that is contrary to EU law.

Alternatively, Anna could also bring a case before the ECJ under Article 267 TFEU, which allows for the preliminary reference procedure. If Anna's case is pending before the Italian courts, she could ask the Italian court to refer the case to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling. This would allow the ECJ to interpret EU law and provide guidance to the Italian court on whether the decision is in conformity with EU law.

**B(i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not?**

The Portuguese authority's decision to deny Carmen, Juan's Argentine wife, a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen may be in breach of EU law. According to the case law, the right of entry into the territory of a Member State granted to a third-country national who is the spouse of a national of a Member State derives from the family relationship alone (Case C-355/98 Commission v Belgium, paragraph 27). Therefore, the Portuguese authorities should not deny Carmen a residence permit solely because she is not a Union citizen.

Moreover, the decision may interfere with Carmen's right to family life, which is protected under EU law. The right to family life is a fundamental right that should not be restricted without a valid justification (Case C-281/98 Angonese, paragraph 41). In this case, the Portuguese authorities' decision to deny Carmen a residence permit could be seen as an unjustified interference with this right.

**B(ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation?**

If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits to third-country nationals who are the spouses of Union citizens, the Commission could bring an infringement proceeding against Portugal under Article 258 TFEU. This would allow the Commission to challenge Portugal's failure to comply with its obligations under EU law.

Alternatively, the Commission could also bring a case before the ECJ under Article 267 TFEU, seeking a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of EU law. This would allow the ECJ to provide guidance to the Commission and other Member States on the correct application of EU law in this context.

In addition, the Commission could also bring a case before the ECJ under Article 259 TFEU, seeking a declaration that Portugal has failed to comply with its obligations under EU law. This would allow the ECJ to declare Portugal's conduct to be contrary to EU law and potentially impose a fine or other penalty.","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","1) The duty of Member States to fulfil their EU obligations is primarily based on Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), which states that ""The Union shall be based on representative democracy, and shall ensure that its institutions are open, transparent and accessible to its citizens."" This principle is further elaborated in Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which outlines the legal basis for EU legislation and the obligations of Member States to comply with EU law.

2) Yes, the European Union can take formal action towards Italy if it suspects that the country is breaching Union law. The formal action typically involves the following steps:
   - The Commission may issue a formal letter of formal notice to Italy, requesting it to comply with the obligations under the Directive.
   - If Italy fails to comply, the Commission may issue a reasoned opinion, outlining the breach and requiring Italy to take the necessary measures to comply.
   - If Italy still fails to comply, the Commission may refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a preliminary ruling or, in the case of a serious and persistent breach, for a judgment.

3) If the case is referred to the CJEU and the Court finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, the following may happen:
   - The CJEU will issue a judgment, which is binding on Italy.
   - If Italy fails to comply with the judgment, the Commission may take further action under Article 258 TFEU, which provides for the infringement procedure. This may include the imposition of a fine or other penalties.
   - In the case of a serious and persistent breach, the Commission may also propose to the Council to adopt a decision to suspend certain rights and obligations of Italy under the Treaties, as outlined in Article 7 TEU.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,

#### a) Summary of Relevant Facts
In the case ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix,"" the Commission of the European Communities (hereafter ""the Commission"") brought an action against Frédéric Daffix. The dispute revolved around whether the Commission's decision to impose a fine on Daffix was based on a proper statement of reasons. The Commission alleged that Daffix's conduct violated EU competition rules, specifically Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty (now Article 101 of the TFEU).

#### b) Procedures
The case was initially brought before the Court of First Instance (CFI), which is now the General Court. The CFI considered the case and issued a judgment. The Commission then appealed this judgment to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The CJEU reviewed the CFI's decision and rendered its judgment.

#### c) Central Legal Issue(s)
The central legal issue discussed by the CJEU was whether the Commission's decision to impose a fine on Daffix was based on a proper statement of reasons. Specifically, the Court had to determine if the Commission had provided sufficient reasons for its decision, allowing Daffix to understand the basis of the fine and enabling the Court to review its legality.

#### d) Relevant Legal Rules
The relevant legal rules in this case include:
- Article 253 EC (now Article 263 TFEU), which requires institutions of the EU to state the reasons for their decisions.
- The case-law of the CJEU, which emphasizes the importance of a proper statement of reasons in decisions that adversely affect individuals.

#### e) Parties' Arguments and Court's Analysis
The Commission argued that its decision to impose a fine on Daffix was based on a proper statement of reasons, as it had provided sufficient details to allow Daffix to understand the basis of the fine and to enable the Court to review its legality. Daffix, on the other hand, contended that the Commission's statement of reasons was inadequate and did not meet the requirements of Article 253 EC.

The CJEU analyzed the case by referring to its established case-law, particularly the principles laid down in cases such as ""Michel v Parliament"" [1981] ECR 2861, ""Lux v Court of Auditors"" [1984] ECR 2447, and ""Pérez-Mínguez Casariego v Commission"" [1991] ECR II-143. The Court emphasized that a proper statement of reasons must be sufficient to allow the person concerned to ascertain whether the decision is well-founded and to enable the Court to review its legality.

#### f) Conclusion
The CJEU concluded that the Commission's decision to impose a fine on Daffix was not based on a proper statement of reasons. The Court held that the Commission had not provided sufficient details to enable Daffix to understand the basis of the fine or to allow the Court to review its legality. Therefore, the CJEU annulled the Commission's decision.

### 2. Legal Analysis

The case ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"" is significant in the general scheme of EU law for several reasons. Firstly, it underscores the importance of a proper statement of reasons in decisions that adversely affect individuals. This principle is a cornerstone of the rule of law and ensures that individuals have the opportunity to challenge decisions that affect their rights.

The case also highlights the role of the CJEU in reviewing the legality of decisions made by EU institutions. By requiring a proper statement of reasons, the Court ensures that decisions are transparent and can be scrutinized effectively. This is particularly important in the context of competition law, where decisions can have significant economic and legal implications.

Moreover, the case reflects the Court's commitment to ensuring that EU law is applied consistently and fairly. The CJEU's analysis of the Commission's decision demonstrates its willingness to hold EU institutions accountable for their actions, even when those actions involve imposing penalties on individuals.

In the context of procedural law, the case reinforces the importance of clear and precise statements of the subject-matter of proceedings and the pleas in law. This principle is essential for ensuring that the defendant can prepare a proper defense and that the Court can rule effectively on the application. The CJEU's emphasis on these procedural requirements underscores the importance of clarity and precision in legal proceedings.

Overall, ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"" is a significant case that highlights the importance of transparency, accountability, and fairness in the application of EU law. It underscores the role of the CJEU in ensuring that EU institutions act in accordance with the rule of law and that individuals have the opportunity to challenge decisions that affect their rights.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","a) An absolute right is a fundamental right that is unconditional and can be exercised without any restrictions. It is a right that is inherent to the individual and cannot be taken away or limited by any authority. An example of an absolute right from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is the right to life (Article 2). On the other hand, a relative right is a fundamental right that can be subject to limitations and restrictions, provided that these limitations are proportionate and necessary. An example of a relative right from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is the right to privacy and personal data protection (Article 8).

b) In the case of 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that ""respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the Court of Justice."" This shift in the Court's approach can be attributed to two main reasons. Firstly, the Court recognized that the Member States' constitutional traditions were increasingly converging, making it more feasible to draw inspiration from these traditions to protect fundamental rights. Secondly, the Court acknowledged that the Community's legal order was becoming more complex and that fundamental rights were necessary to ensure the protection of individuals within this evolving framework.

c) The three principal sources of EU fundamental rights are:
1. The constitutional traditions common to the Member States (Article 6(1) TEU).
2. The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) (Article 6(2) TEU).
3. International treaties for the protection of human rights on which the Member States have collaborated or of which they are signatories (Article 6(3) TEU).

These sources are stated in the Treaty on European Union (TEU), specifically in Article 6.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,

Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","A) The decision of the Italian authorities to refuse Maria's residence renewal on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation is not in conformity with EU law. According to Article 39 EC (now Article 45 TFEU), freedom of movement for workers entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration, and other conditions of work and employment. This principle is further clarified in case law such as Case C-281/98 Angonese, which states that workers must be treated equally regardless of their nationality. Additionally, Case C-385/00 De Groot emphasizes that the State of origin cannot obstruct the freedom of one of its nationals to accept and pursue employment in another Member State. Therefore, the fact that Maria is working fewer hours does not negate her status as a worker and her right to reside in Italy under EU law.

B) Maria has other options to reside in Italy beyond being a 'EU worker'. According to Case C-292/89 Antonissen, the right of residence for a worker is subject to the condition that the person remains a worker or, where relevant, a person seeking employment. However, if Maria can demonstrate that she is not seeking employment, she might be able to rely on other provisions of EU law to reside in Italy. For instance, if she can prove that she is a student or a self-sufficient person, she might be able to rely on the provisions of Article 21 TFEU, which grants the right to move and reside freely within the EU to persons who are not workers. Alternatively, if Maria is a family member of an EU citizen exercising their right to freedom of movement, she might be able to rely on the provisions of Article 21(2) TFEU.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,

Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA

#### Summary of Relevant Facts
The case involved a dispute between Consorzio Italian Management (CIM) and Catania Multiservizi SpA (CM) on one side, and Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA (RFI) on the other. The dispute centered around the interpretation of the provisions of the European Union (EU) law regarding the application of the public procurement directives. Specifically, the parties disagreed on the interpretation of the provisions concerning the award of public contracts.

#### Procedures
The case was brought before the national court in Italy, which referred specific questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a preliminary ruling. The national court sought clarification on the interpretation of the EU directives in the context of the public procurement process. The CJEU, in accordance with Article 234 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), was required to provide a ruling on the questions submitted by the national court.

#### Central Legal Issue(s)
The central legal issue discussed by the Court of Justice was the interpretation of the EU public procurement directives, specifically Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement. The key question was whether the national court's interpretation of the directive was consistent with EU law.

#### Relevant Legal Rules
The relevant legal rules in this case included:
- Article 234 TFEU, which provides for the cooperation between the CJEU and national courts in the context of preliminary rulings.
- Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement, which sets out the rules for the award of public contracts in the EU.

#### Parties' Arguments and Court's Analysis
The parties presented their arguments based on their interpretations of the relevant EU directives. CIM and CM argued that the national court's interpretation of the directive was incorrect and that it should be aligned with the EU's intended purpose. RFI, on the other hand, contended that the national court's interpretation was correct and consistent with EU law.

The Court of Justice analyzed the arguments presented by both parties and considered the relevant case law, including settled principles from previous cases such as Case C-415/93 Bosman and Case C-316/04 Stichting Zuid-Hollandse Milieufederatie. The Court emphasized the importance of ensuring that national courts apply EU law correctly and consistently.

#### Conclusion
The Court of Justice concluded that the national court's interpretation of the Directive 2014/24/EU was not consistent with EU law. The Court provided a detailed analysis of the relevant provisions and held that the national court's interpretation did not align with the objectives and principles of the EU public procurement directives. The Court's ruling was aimed at ensuring the uniform application of EU law across the member states.

### Legal Analysis

#### Importance of the Case in the General Scheme of EU Law
The case C-561/19 is significant in the general scheme of EU law for several reasons. Firstly, it underscores the importance of the preliminary ruling mechanism under Article 234 TFEU. This mechanism ensures that national courts can seek clarification from the CJEU on the interpretation of EU law, thereby promoting the uniform application of EU law across the member states.

Secondly, the case highlights the role of the CJEU in ensuring that national courts correctly interpret and apply EU directives. The Court's ruling in this case serves as a reminder to national courts of their obligation to align their interpretations with the objectives and principles of EU law. This is particularly important in the context of public procurement, where the uniform application of EU law is crucial for ensuring fair competition and transparency.

Thirdly, the case reinforces the principle of direct effect of EU law. The Court's ruling emphasizes that EU directives can have direct effect and that national courts must ensure that their decisions are consistent with the provisions of EU law. This principle is essential for the effective functioning of the EU legal order and the protection of the rights of individuals and businesses.

#### Relation to Studied Topics
The case C-561/19 is related to several topics studied in the course, including:
- **Preliminary Rulings**: The case illustrates the importance of the preliminary ruling mechanism and the role of the CJEU in ensuring the uniform application of EU law.
- **Public Procurement**: The case deals with the interpretation of the EU public procurement directives, which are a key area of EU law.
- **Direct Effect of EU Law**: The case reinforces the principle of direct effect of EU law and the obligation of national courts to apply EU law correctly.

In conclusion, the case C-561/19 is an important decision that underscores the role of the CJEU in ensuring the uniform application of EU law and the correct interpretation of EU directives. It serves as a reminder to national courts of their obligations under EU law and the importance of the preliminary ruling mechanism.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"The provided context does not directly define or explain the terms ""indirect challenge of an EU act,"" ""national procedural autonomy,"" ""the principle of supremacy,"" ""non-legislative EU act,"" or ""field of application of EU fundamental rights."" However, we can infer some relevant information from the given cases.

Regarding the concept of implementation and application of EU rules, the case ""Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union"" mentions that implementation comprises both the drawing-up of implementing rules and the application of rules to specific cases. This could be related to the concept of ""non-legislative EU act,"" as it involves the application of rules, but the context does not provide a direct definition.

The cases ""European Commission v Kingdom of Belgium,"" ""European Commission v Republic of Austria,"" ""European Commission v French Republic,"" ""European Commission v Grand Duchy of Luxemburg,"" and ""European Commission v Federal Republic of Germany"" all refer to the concept of the ""exercise of official authority"" within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 45 EC. They emphasize the importance of ensuring that the effectiveness of the Treaty in the field of freedom of establishment is not frustrated by unilateral provisions of the Member States. This could be seen as related to ""the principle of supremacy,"" which generally refers to the precedence of EU law over national law, but the context does not explicitly define this principle.

The case ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic"" discusses the need for national legislation to address an essential interest or an overriding requirement relating to the general interest and to conform to the principle of proportionality. This touches upon the idea of ""national procedural autonomy,"" which generally refers to the freedom of Member States to choose the procedures for implementing EU law, but again, the context does not provide a direct explanation of this term.

Lastly, the ""field of application of EU fundamental rights"" is not directly addressed in the provided context. However, the cases mentioned do refer to the importance of ensuring the effectiveness of the Treaty, which could imply the protection of fundamental rights within the scope of EU law, but without more specific information, it's challenging to provide a detailed explanation.

In summary, while the provided context offers insights into the implementation and application of EU rules, the exercise of official authority, and the principles guiding national legislation, it does not directly define or explain the requested terms. The explanations provided are based on the closest related concepts found within the given cases.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","In the dispute between Happy Times and Big Fun, the question arises whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive to justify the sale of the 'Bang' toy gun in Sweden, despite the Swedish legislation prohibiting 'immoral or inappropriate toys', including those imitating firearms. The Safe Toys Directive, as a maximum harmonization act, aims to regulate all issues related to the production, marketing, and sale of toys in the Member States, thereby limiting the situations when a toy may be banned. According to the directive, a toy may only be prohibited if it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'.

However, the situation is complicated by the fact that Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the implementation period having passed. In 'Proceedings for compulsory reconstruction against Smanor SA', it is noted that a prohibition on selling a product under a different name may indirectly impede trade between Member States. Similarly, in 'The Queen, on the application of: Swedish Match AB and Swedish Match UK Ltd v Secretary of State for Health', it is stated that measures may be taken to require Member States to authorize the marketing of a product, subject to certain conditions. 

In the context of the Safe Toys Directive, Big Fun may argue that the Swedish ban on toys imitating firearms is not justified under the directive, as the 'Bang' toy gun is not 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. The directive's goal of limiting the situations when a toy may be banned suggests that the Swedish legislation may be too restrictive. Furthermore, as seen in 'Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG v Centrafarm Vertriebsgesellschaft Pharmazeutischer Erzeugnisse mbH', the exercise of a right may constitute a 'disguised restriction on trade between Member States' if it affects the marketing of products from other Member States differently from that of domestic products.

Additionally, 'Boehringer Ingelheim KG, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG, Glaxo Group Ltd, The Wellcome Foundation Ltd, SmithKline Beecham plc, Beecham Group plc, SmithKline & French Laboratories Ltd and Eli Lilly and Co. v Swingward Ltd and Dowelhurst Ltd' clarifies that a derogation from free movement of goods cannot be accepted if it constitutes a disguised restriction on trade between Member States. In this case, the Swedish ban on toys imitating firearms may be seen as a restriction on the free movement of goods, as it affects the marketing of the 'Bang' toy gun from Denmark.

However, it is also important to consider the principle established in 'Criminal proceedings against Gunnar Nilsson, Per Olov Hagelgren and Solweig Arrborn', which states that an obligation on all traders to have their products distributed by a method authorized under national rules does not fall within the scope of Article 30 of the Treaty if it applies without distinction as to the origin of the products. In this case, the Swedish legislation prohibiting 'immoral or inappropriate toys' applies to both domestic and imported products, which may suggest that it does not constitute a restriction on trade between Member States.

Ultimately, the question of whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive to justify the sale of the 'Bang' toy gun in Sweden will depend on the interpretation of the directive and the Swedish legislation in light of the principles established in the relevant case law. The court will need to consider whether the Swedish ban on toys imitating firearms is justified under the directive and whether it constitutes a restriction on the free movement of goods. If the court finds that the ban is not justified and constitutes a restriction on trade, Big Fun may be able to rely on the Safe Toys Directive to challenge the Swedish legislation and continue selling the 'Bang' toy gun in Sweden.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","The EU law terms and concepts in question can be defined and explained as follows:

a) Special legislative procedure: This refers to a specific process outlined in the Treaty for adopting certain legislative acts. As noted in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"", the legal basis of a measure determines the procedure to be followed in adopting that measure. This principle is supported by the judgments in ""Parliament v Council"", which emphasize the importance of the legal basis in determining the applicable procedure.

b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs): These are rules enacted by Member States that are capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade. As established in ""Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany"" and further supported by ""Dassonville"", ""Deutscher Apothekerverband"", ""Rosengren and Others"", ""Commission v Netherlands"", and ""Ludwigs-Apotheke"", such measures are prohibited under Article 28 EC. Similarly, ""Commission of the European Communities v Republic of Austria"" and ""Commission v Denmark"" reinforce this principle, highlighting that MEQRs can be justified on grounds of public interest or imperative requirements, as long as they are proportionate and necessary.

c) Concerted practices: Unfortunately, the provided context does not directly address concerted practices. However, it is a concept related to competition law, often discussed in the context of restrictive agreements and the prohibition on anti-competitive practices.

d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: While the context does not explicitly define enforcement actions or infringement proceedings, these terms generally refer to the processes by which the European Commission or other bodies ensure compliance with EU law. This can involve proceedings against Member States for failing to fulfill their obligations, as seen in cases like ""Commission v Greece"" (not directly mentioned but implied through the discussion of enforcement mechanisms in similar contexts).

e) Proportionality: This principle requires that national provisions or measures must be appropriate for securing the attainment of the objective pursued and not go beyond what is necessary to attain it. As outlined in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of the Netherlands"", this is a crucial criterion for justifying measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions. The principle is further supported by ""Radiosistemi"" and ""ATRAL"", which emphasize the need for proportionality in achieving the desired objectives without unnecessarily hindering intra-Community trade.","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law.","The scenario presented involves several aspects of EU law, particularly concerning the definition of an ""EU worker,"" the right to equal treatment, and restrictions based on nationality and language requirements.

a) The Belgian authorities' decision to no longer consider Cynthia an ""EU worker"" due to her reduced working hours may not be in accordance with EU law. The concept of a ""worker"" under EU law is defined broadly and includes individuals who work part-time, as long as the work is genuine and effective. The reduction in working hours alone does not necessarily mean Cynthia no longer qualifies as a worker. This interpretation is supported by the principle that the definition of a worker should be given a broad interpretation to ensure the effectiveness of EU law, as seen in cases like ""Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon,"" which emphasizes the importance of applying EU provisions to workers once they are admitted into the public service of a Member State.

b) The rejection of Cynthia's application for a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media solely on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen may not be in accordance with EU law. According to ""Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon"" and ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium,"" Article 39(4) EC allows Member States to restrict access to certain public service positions that require a special relationship of allegiance to the State. However, this does not automatically disentitle EU workers from applying for positions that do not inherently require such allegiance. The principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, as outlined in Article 7 of the Treaty and supported by cases like ""Commission of the European Communities v Grand Duchy of Luxemburg,"" suggests that EU citizens should have equal access to employment opportunities unless specific exceptions apply.

c) The rejection of Cynthia's application due to her not being a Belgian citizen and not meeting the linguistic requirements may also raise questions under EU law. While ""Government of the French Community and Walloon Government v Flemish Government"" and other cases like ""Uecker and Jacquet"" suggest that citizenship of the Union does not extend to internal situations without a link to Community law, the principle of non-discrimination and equal treatment should still apply to EU citizens residing in another Member State. The requirement for an advanced level of other EU languages for the job at a private academy could be justified if it is a genuine occupational requirement, but rejecting her solely on the basis of nationality would likely be in contravention of EU law. The ""Mouvement contre le racisme, l'antisémitisme et la xénophobie ASBL (MRAX) v Belgian State"" case highlights the importance of not discriminating against individuals based on their nationality, especially in the context of residence and employment rights.

In conclusion, the decisions made by the Belgian authorities and the private academy regarding Cynthia's employment and residence status raise several concerns under EU law, particularly regarding the definition of an EU worker, equal treatment, and non-discrimination on grounds of nationality. EU law generally supports the principle of equal treatment for EU citizens across Member States, with specific exceptions that must be carefully justified.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","To resolve the EU law-related issues in the case between Big Money and Good Enough, we must examine the relationship between the Safe Building Directive and the 1948 Law on Public Safety in Fantasia, as well as the implications of Article 20 of the directive. The key issue here is whether Good Enough can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive to argue that the requirement for a shelter under the 1948 Law on Public Safety should be set aside.

Firstly, it's essential to consider the principle of legal certainty, as discussed in ""Belgische Staat v Cobelfret NV"". This principle suggests that the Court may exceptionally restrict the opportunity for a person to rely on a provision that has been interpreted, but only if certain criteria are met, including good faith and the risk of serious difficulties. However, in this case, we are dealing with the interpretation of EU law in relation to national law, rather than the restriction of reliance on an interpreted provision.

The Safe Building Directive aims to harmonize building standards across the EU, and Article 20 explicitly states that Member States may not introduce further requirements beyond what is laid down in Articles 5-15. Since Articles 5-15 do not mention shelters, Good Enough argues that the 1948 Law on Public Safety's requirement for a shelter is precluded by Article 20 of the directive.

However, the fact that Fantasia implemented the Safe Building Directive by adopting the 2016 Construction Act, which reproduces Articles 5-15 of the directive, but did not repeal or amend the 1948 Law on Public Safety, raises questions about the intention of the national legislature. It could be argued that the failure to repeal the 1948 Law was an oversight, but it is also possible that the national legislature intended to maintain the public safety requirements as a separate issue, as Big Money suggests.

In ""Jobra Vermögensverwaltungs-Gesellschaft mbH v Finanzamt Amstetten Melk Scheibbs"", the Court acknowledged that the balanced allocation of power to impose taxes could be a legitimate requirement, but this case-law does not directly apply to the present situation. Instead, we must consider the principles of EU law harmonization and the relationship between EU directives and national law.

The ""Kingdom of Spain v Commission of the European Communities"" and ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities"" cases provide guidance on the adequacy of reasons for decisions in the context of the clearance of accounts, emphasizing the importance of the Member State's involvement in the decision-making process and its awareness of the reasons behind the Commission's decisions. While these cases do not directly address the issue at hand, they highlight the significance of transparency and cooperation between the EU institutions and Member States.

Ultimately, to resolve the dispute, we must consider whether the 1948 Law on Public Safety's requirement for a shelter is indeed precluded by Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive. If the national legislature's intention was to maintain the public safety requirements as a separate issue, then the 1948 Law on Public Safety might still be applicable. However, if the failure to repeal the law was an oversight, and the Safe Building Directive is intended to harmonize building standards, including those related to public safety, then Good Enough's argument might prevail.

In conclusion, the resolution of the EU law-related issues in this case requires a careful examination of the relationship between the Safe Building Directive and the 1948 Law on Public Safety, as well as the principles of EU law harmonization and the relationship between EU directives and national law. The court must consider the intentions of the national legislature, the scope of the Safe Building Directive, and the implications of Article 20 to determine whether Good Enough can rely on the directive to argue that the shelter requirement should be set aside.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","The provided context does not directly define or explain the terms ""ordinary legislative procedure (OLP)"", ""state liability"", ""preliminary ruling procedure"", ""indirect effect"", or ""subsidiarity"" in a straightforward manner. However, we can attempt to address these concepts based on the information given and general knowledge of EU law principles.

a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) is not explicitly defined in the provided context. However, it is a procedure where the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopt legislation on an equal footing, typically requiring the approval of both institutions. This concept is not directly addressed in the given context, but the relationship between legal basis and procedures is mentioned in ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"", suggesting that the legal basis of a measure determines the procedure to be followed.

b) State liability refers to the principle that Member States can be held liable for damages resulting from breaches of EU law. While the context does not directly address state liability, the concept of non-contractual liability is touched upon in ""Gestoras Pro Amnistía, Juan Mari Olano Olano and Julen Zelarain Errasti v Council of the European Union"", indicating that a system of legal remedies, including non-contractual liability, is established by the treaties, and any reform would need to be in accordance with Article 48 EU. Furthermore, ""Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others"" discusses the system of rules regarding liability for legislative measures, considering factors like the complexity of situations and the margin of discretion available to the author of the act.

c) The preliminary ruling procedure is a process where national courts can refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law to the Court of Justice of the European Union. This concept is not directly explained in the provided context, but ""European Commission v Systran SA and Systran Luxembourg SA"" mentions the division of jurisdiction between Community Courts and national courts, which is relevant to understanding how national courts interact with EU law and potentially seek preliminary rulings.

d) Indirect effect refers to the principle that national courts must interpret national law in a way that is consistent with EU law, even if the EU law in question has not been directly transposed into national law. The provided context does not explicitly discuss indirect effect, but the importance of ensuring the effectiveness of EU law is hinted at in ""European Commission v Republic of Austria"", where it is mentioned that the assessment of certain concepts must take into account the character of EU law to prevent unilateral provisions of Member States from frustrating the Treaty's objectives.

e) Subsidiarity is the principle that decisions should be taken at the lowest level of government possible, ideally at the local or national level rather than the EU level, if the issue can be effectively addressed there. The context does not directly address subsidiarity, but ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"" discusses the legal basis for measures and the filling of gaps where no specific provisions confer express or implied powers on the Community institutions, which can be related to the broader discussion on the appropriate level of action in the EU framework. 

In summary, while the provided context does not offer direct explanations for these EU law terms and concepts, relevant principles and related ideas are touched upon in various cases, highlighting the complexity and interconnectedness of EU law.","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,

**A. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law?**

The Italian public school's decision to deny Anna employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen raises concerns about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality. According to the case-law, a measure that draws a distinction on the basis of residence or nationality is liable to operate mainly to the detriment of nationals of other Member States (see 'Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic', paragraph 14). In this case, the school's decision appears to be discriminatory, as it puts Anna, a Swedish citizen, at a disadvantage compared to Italian citizens.

Furthermore, the decision may also interfere with Anna's right to free movement of workers, as guaranteed by EU law. The 'Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic' (paragraph 20) suggests that a requirement of residence in a Member State can negate the freedom to provide services, and by extension, the freedom of movement of workers.

However, it is possible that the Italian authorities could justify the decision by relying on a public interest ground, such as the need to protect the Italian labor market. Nevertheless, according to 'Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic' (paragraph 62), such an obstacle may be justified only in so far as the public interest relied on is not already safeguarded by the rules to which the service provider (or worker) is subject in the Member State in which it is established. In this case, it is unclear whether the Italian authorities have provided a valid justification for the decision.

**A. ii) What remedies might be available to her?**

If Anna wishes to challenge the Italian public school's decision, she may be able to bring court proceedings against the decision. According to EU law, individuals may rely on EU law before national courts, and national courts are required to apply EU law and set aside any conflicting national law (see 'Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic', paragraph 10). Anna could potentially bring a claim before an Italian court, arguing that the school's decision is discriminatory and infringes her rights under EU law.

Alternatively, if the Italian authorities fail to provide a remedy or if the national courts do not provide an effective remedy, Anna may be able to complain to the European Commission, which could potentially bring an infringement action against Italy (see 'Commission of the European Communities v Portuguese Republic', paragraph 25).

**B. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law?**

The Portuguese authority's decision to deny Carmen, an Argentine citizen and wife of a Spanish citizen, a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen raises concerns about the right of entry into the territory of a Member State. According to 'Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Spain' (paragraph 28), the right of entry into the territory of a Member State granted to a third-country national who is the spouse of a national of a Member State derives from the family relationship alone. This suggests that Carmen, as the spouse of a Spanish citizen, may have a right to enter and reside in Portugal, regardless of her nationality.

However, the 'Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Spain' (paragraph 28) also suggests that the issue of a residence permit to a third-country national who is the spouse of a Member State national is a measure by a Member State serving to prove the individual position of a national of a third country with regard to provisions of Community law. This implies that the Portuguese authorities may have some discretion in determining whether to grant a residence permit to Carmen.

**B. ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation?**

If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits to spouses of EU citizens, such as Carmen, the European Commission may be able to bring an infringement action against Portugal (see 'Commission of the European Communities v Portuguese Republic', paragraph 25). The Commission could argue that Portugal's practice is inconsistent with EU law, specifically the right of entry into the territory of a Member State granted to family members of EU citizens.

Additionally, the Commission could rely on the principle that the apprehension of internal difficulties cannot justify a failure by a Member State to comply with its obligations under Community law (see 'Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities', paragraph 78). This principle suggests that Portugal cannot justify its failure to grant residence permits to spouses of EU citizens by relying on internal difficulties or administrative concerns.

In the event of an infringement action, the Court of Justice of the European Union could potentially rule that Portugal's practice is inconsistent with EU law and require Portugal to change its practice and grant residence permits to eligible spouses of EU citizens.","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","The questions posed relate to the obligations of Member States under EU law, specifically in the context of environmental protection and the reporting requirements set forth by Directive (EU) 2016/2284. 

1. The duty of Member States to fulfill their EU obligations is a fundamental principle of EU law, rooted in the concept of loyalty as expressed in Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), which states that Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfillment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. This principle is crucial in ensuring the effective implementation of EU directives, including those related to environmental protection like Directive (EU) 2016/2284.

2. If the European Union suspects that Italy is breaching Union law by failing to submit the required reports under Directive (EU) 2016/2284, it can take formal action. The European Commission, acting as the guardian of the Treaties, can initiate infringement proceedings against Italy. This process typically begins with a letter of formal notice, followed by a reasoned opinion if the issue is not resolved. If the Member State still fails to comply, the Commission can refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), as seen in cases like 'Commission v Italy' and 'Commission v Greece'. The CJEU can then rule on whether the Member State has failed to fulfill its obligations under EU law.

3. If the CJEU finds that Italy has failed to fulfill an obligation under the Treaties and Italy refuses to comply with the judgment, the Commission can launch a second stage of infringement proceedings. According to Article 260 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment, it may refer the matter to the CJEU again, which can impose a lump sum or penalty payment on Italy. This mechanism is designed to ensure that Member States comply with EU law and the judgments of the CJEU, maintaining the rule of law and the effectiveness of the EU's legal system. The principle that Member States must comply with EU law and CJEU judgments is underscored by cases such as 'Commission v Italy', where the importance of adhering to environmental directives and the procedures for addressing non-compliance are highlighted.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,
"1. Present the decision of the case. This presentation should include, in your own words (only highlighting text in the judgment won't give points), a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","The decision of the case revolves around the principles of EU law, specifically focusing on the requirements for a proper statement of reasons in decisions and the rules of procedure for applications to the Court of Justice. The cases presented involve various parties, including the Commission of the European Communities, member states like Finland, Ireland, and Italy, and other entities such as the European Parliament and Council of the European Union. The disputes generally concern the adequacy of statements of reasons provided by decisions and the clarity of applications submitted to the Court.

Procedurally, these cases have gone through the Court of Justice, with some originating from the Court of First Instance. The Court's role is to assess whether the decisions in question comply with the requirement to state reasons, as mandated by Article 253 EC, and whether applications meet the standards set out in Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure. This involves evaluating the clarity and precision of the statements of reasons and the summaries of pleas in law, ensuring they are sufficient for the defendant to prepare a defense and for the Court to rule on the application.

The central legal issue discussed by the Court of Justice is the interpretation and application of the duty to provide a statement of reasons for acts that are intended to produce legal effects on the addressees. This duty is enshrined in Article 253 EC, which requires that such acts state the reasons on which they are based. The Court has consistently held that the statement of reasons must be appropriate to the act at issue, disclosing the reasoning followed by the institution in a clear and unequivocal fashion. This allows the persons concerned to understand the reasons for the measure and enables the Court to exercise its power of review.

The relevant legal rules, as outlined in the cases, include Article 253 EC and Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure. These provisions emphasize the importance of clear and precise statements of reasons and summaries of pleas in law. The parties have argued over the adequacy of the statements of reasons provided and the clarity of the applications, with the Court analyzing these arguments in light of the legal rules and precedents such as ""Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France"" and ""Bertelsmann and Sony Corporation of America v Impala"".

The Court's analysis involves assessing whether the statement of reasons meets the requirements of Article 253 EC, considering the context and all legal rules governing the matter. It also examines whether the application complies with Article 38(1)(c), ensuring the subject-matter of the proceedings and the summary of the pleas in law are sufficiently clear and precise. The Court's conclusion regarding these issues is crucial, as it determines the validity of the decisions and the admissibility of the applications.

In the general scheme of EU law, this case is significant because it underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in the decision-making process of EU institutions. The duty to provide a statement of reasons is a fundamental principle of EU law, ensuring that individuals are informed of the reasons behind decisions affecting them and that the Court can review the legality of such decisions. This case reflects the Court's efforts to balance the need for effective decision-making with the need for transparency and the protection of individual rights.

The judgment's emphasis on the clarity and precision required in statements of reasons and applications highlights the importance of procedural rules in ensuring the fairness and efficiency of the judicial process. It also demonstrates the Court's role in interpreting and applying EU law, providing guidance on the scope and application of key provisions like Article 253 EC and Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure. By examining the reasoning and conclusions of the Court, we gain insight into the substantive and procedural law of the EU, including the principles of transparency, accountability, and the protection of individual rights. 

The case's areas of substantive and procedural law intersect with broader topics in EU law, such as the principles of good administration, the right to a fair hearing, and the rule of law. These principles are essential to the functioning of the EU legal system, ensuring that decisions are made in a transparent, accountable, and lawful manner. The judgment's discussion of the duty to provide a statement of reasons and the requirements for applications to the Court of Justice contributes to our understanding of these principles and their application in practice.

In conclusion, the case presents a comprehensive overview of the legal framework governing the duty to provide a statement of reasons and the rules of procedure for applications to the Court of Justice. The Court's analysis and conclusions provide valuable insights into the interpretation and application of key EU law provisions, highlighting the importance of transparency, accountability, and the protection of individual rights in the EU legal system.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","The context provided does not directly address the questions posed, particularly regarding the distinction between absolute and relative rights, the specific reasoning behind the court's direction in case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, and the explicit mention of the three principal sources of EU fundamental rights in the treaties. However, we can infer and discuss these topics based on the general principles outlined in the given context.

a) The distinction between absolute and relative rights is a concept that is not directly explained in the provided context. Generally, absolute rights are considered inalienable and inviolable, whereas relative rights may be subject to limitations and restrictions under certain conditions. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, while not explicitly mentioned in the context, does contain provisions that could be interpreted as examples of both absolute and relative rights. For instance, the right to life (Article 2 of the Charter) could be seen as an absolute right, whereas freedom of expression (Article 11) might be considered a relative right, as it can be subject to certain restrictions.

b) The case of 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft is not directly discussed in the provided context, but the principle that ""respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice"" is a recurring theme. The court's direction in acknowledging fundamental rights can be attributed to the need to ensure that the Community's legal order is aligned with the constitutional traditions common to the Member States and international human rights instruments. This approach allows the court to draw inspiration from these sources, ensuring that the protection of fundamental rights within the Community framework is consistent with broader European and international standards. The hesitation to acknowledge these rights in the past may have stemmed from concerns about the legal basis for such protections within the Community legal order, but the court's evolution on this issue reflects a growing recognition of the importance of fundamental rights in the EU's legal framework.

c) The three principal sources of EU fundamental rights, often referred to as a ""bill of rights,"" are not explicitly listed in the provided context as being stated in specific treaties. However, based on the information given, these sources can be inferred to include the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, international treaties for the protection of human rights (with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, or ECHR, holding special significance), and the general principles of Community law as developed by the Court of Justice. The treaties that form the basis of the EU, including the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), contain provisions related to the protection of fundamental rights, but the specific enumeration of these three sources as a ""bill of rights"" is not directly mentioned in the context provided. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is now a part of the EU's legal framework, explicitly outlines these rights, but its inclusion in the treaties (notably, the Treaty of Lisbon) is what gives it binding force.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","The decision of the Italian authorities to refuse Maria's residence renewal on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation as a full-time worker is not entirely in conformity with EU law. According to the ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Denmark"" and ""Lawrie-Blum"", a person who performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for remuneration must be considered a worker, as long as the activities are real and genuine, and not purely marginal and ancillary. The fact that Maria is working 15 hours a week as a science teacher could still be considered a genuine occupation, and thus, she might still be entitled to freedom of movement as a worker.

However, the Italian authorities' decision may be influenced by the condition that migrant workers must remain in a gainful occupation to maintain their right of residence, as stated in ""Georgios Orfanopoulos and Others (C-482/01) and Raffaele Oliveri (C-493/01) v Land Baden-Württemberg"" and ""Antonissen"". 

Regarding the second part of the question, Maria may have other options beyond being an 'EU worker' to reside in Italy. As stated in ""Georgios Orfanopoulos and Others (C-482/01) and Raffaele Oliveri (C-493/01) v Land Baden-Württemberg"", she may derive her right of residence from other provisions of Community law. For instance, if she has sufficient resources and health insurance, she may be considered a self-sufficient person, or if she is a student or a retiree, she may have a right of residence under different conditions. Nevertheless, these alternatives would depend on her specific circumstances and the applicable EU law provisions. 

In conclusion, the decision of the Italian authorities may not be entirely in line with EU law, and Maria may have other options to reside in Italy beyond being considered an 'EU worker', depending on her specific situation and the applicable EU law provisions. The ""Andrea Raccanelli v Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften eV"" and ""Commission of the European Communities v Portuguese Republic"" cases emphasize the importance of freedom of movement for workers and the abolition of discrimination based on nationality, which could also support Maria's case.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,
"Throughout the course you have been trained in reading and analysing the case law of the European Court of Justice. Below is a judgment of the European Court of Justice, C-561/19, Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA Your assignment: 1. Present the decision of the case (7 p.). This presentation should include, in your own words, a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","The case of Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA (C-561/19) revolves around a dispute between the two parties concerning a public procurement contract. The relevant facts, as can be inferred from similar cases such as ""Vincenzo Manfredi v Lloyd Adriatico Assicurazioni SpA (C-295/04)"", indicate that the national court, in this instance, would have had to determine the need for a preliminary ruling to enable it to deliver judgment. 

The procedures that occurred in this case likely involved the national court submitting questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling, as seen in cases like ""Grundig Italiana SpA v Ministero delle Finanze"", where the Court of Justice is bound to give a ruling on the interpretation of Community law. The central legal issue discussed by the Court of Justice would have pertained to the interpretation of EU law provisions related to public procurement, possibly touching on the principles of transparency, equal treatment, and the statement of reasons required for certain measures, as outlined in cases such as ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities"" and ""Italian Republic v Council of the European Union"".

The relevant legal rules in this case would have included provisions from the EU treaties and directives related to public procurement, emphasizing the importance of a clear statement of reasons for measures adopted by EU institutions, as seen in ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities"" and ""Italian Republic v Council of the European Union"". The parties would have argued based on these provisions, with the Court of Justice analyzing the legal classification of facts and the legal inferences drawn from them, as is its jurisdiction pursuant to Article 225 EC, as noted in ""European Parliament v Carlo Ripa di Meana, Leoluca Orlando and Gastone Parigi"".

The Court of Justice would have come to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) by applying the principles of EU law, including the obligation to give a ruling when questions concern the interpretation of EU law, as stated in ""Teresa Cicala v Regione Siciliana"" and ""Ministero dell'Industria, del Commercio e dell'Artigianato v Lucchini SpA"". This case highlights the importance of the Court of Justice's role in interpreting EU law and ensuring its uniform application across member states, as well as the significance of preliminary rulings in the cooperation between the Court of Justice and national courts.

In the general scheme of EU law, this case underscores the principles of transparency, equal treatment, and the rule of law, which are fundamental to the EU's legal order. The case reflects on the substantive law related to public procurement and the procedural law concerning preliminary rulings, emphasizing the Court of Justice's jurisdiction to review the legal classification of facts and the legal inferences drawn from them. The importance of a clear statement of reasons for measures adopted by EU institutions is also a critical aspect, as it enables the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for the measure and allows the competent Community Court to exercise its power of review, as seen in ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities"" and ""Italian Republic v Council of the European Union"". 

The case's impact on the development of EU law, particularly in the areas of public procurement and the preliminary ruling procedure, is significant. It reinforces the role of the Court of Justice in ensuring the uniform interpretation and application of EU law, which is crucial for the functioning of the internal market and the protection of individual rights. The case also highlights the need for EU institutions and member states to adhere to the principles of transparency and equal treatment in their actions, which is essential for maintaining trust in the EU's legal system. 

In conclusion, the case of Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA (C-561/19) is an important contribution to the development of EU law, particularly in the areas of public procurement and preliminary rulings. Its emphasis on transparency, equal treatment, and the rule of law reinforces the fundamental principles of the EU's legal order, and its impact will be felt in the ongoing development of EU law and policy.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"a) **Indirect challenge of an EU act**: This term refers to the process by which a national court may indirectly challenge the validity of an EU act by relying on the principles of EU law. Instead of directly questioning the EU act, the national court may argue that the act violates EU law principles, such as the principle of supremacy or the principle of proportionality. This method is often used to ensure the uniform application of EU law across Member States.

b) **National procedural autonomy**: This concept refers to the principle that Member States have the right to determine their own procedural rules for the application of EU law within their territories. While EU law must be applied uniformly, the specific procedures for implementing and enforcing EU law may vary from one Member State to another. This principle is intended to allow for flexibility and adaptability in the application of EU law to different national contexts.

c) **The principle of supremacy**: This is a fundamental principle of EU law that states that EU law takes precedence over national law. In other words, when there is a conflict between an EU act and national legislation, the EU act must be applied and the national law must yield. This principle ensures the uniform application of EU law across the Member States and is crucial for the effectiveness of EU law.

d) **Non-legislative EU act**: This term refers to acts adopted by the EU institutions that are not legislative in nature. These acts can include regulations, directives, decisions, and recommendations. Unlike legislative acts, non-legislative acts do not require the consent of the Council or the European Parliament. They are binding on the Member States and individuals, but they do not have the same legislative force as laws.

e) **Field of application of EU fundamental rights**: This concept refers to the scope within which EU fundamental rights apply. EU fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy, freedom of expression, and the right to a fair trial, are applicable in the context of EU law and the activities of EU institutions. However, their application extends to the Member States' national laws and practices when these are implemented or enforced by EU institutions or when they affect the rights of EU citizens. The field of application of EU fundamental rights is subject to the principle of proportionality and the requirement that the rights must be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the EU's overall objectives and values.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","In the context of the dispute between Happy Times and Big Fun, the question of whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive is complex and hinges on several legal principles and the specific circumstances of the case. The Safe Toys Directive, as a maximum harmonization act, aims to create a uniform framework for the production, marketing, and sale of toys across the EU, thereby addressing the significant differences in national regulations that previously hindered trade in toys. The directive's primary goal is to limit the situations in which toys can be banned, stipulating that such bans can only occur if the toy is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'.

However, Swedish law, as interpreted by Swedish courts, has upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for over three decades. This ban is not aligned with the Safe Toys Directive's requirement for a toy to be 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. The directive's implementation period has long since passed, and Sweden has not yet implemented it. This raises the question of whether Big Fun can rely on the directive to argue that the 'Bang' toy should not be banned under Swedish law.

According to the judgment in Case 27/80 Fietje, a prohibition that makes marketing more difficult and indirectly impedes trade between Member States can be considered a restriction on trade. In the context of the Safe Toys Directive, a failure to implement the directive could potentially be seen as such a restriction, given that it creates a disparity in the application of EU law across Member States. Additionally, the judgment in Case C-359/92 Germany v Council highlights that Member States may be required to authorize the marketing of products subject to certain conditions, or even prohibit marketing under specific circumstances.

However, the judgment in Case C-387/93 Banchero indicates that an obligation on all traders to distribute products by a method authorized under national rules without distinction as to the origin of the products does not fall within the scope of Article 30 of the Treaty. This principle suggests that Big Fun's reliance on the Safe Toys Directive might be limited if the directive's provisions are not uniformly applied across Member States.

Moreover, the judgment in Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG v Centrafarm Vertriebsgesellschaft Pharmazeutische Erzeugnisse mbH emphasizes that the exercise of a trade mark proprietor's right to prevent repackaging can constitute a disguised restriction on trade between Member States if it affects the original condition of the product. While this case is about trade marks, the principle could be extended to argue that Big Fun's reliance on the Safe Toys Directive could be seen as a disguised restriction if it is used to prevent the enforcement of Swedish law that prohibits toys imitating firearms.

In conclusion, while the Safe Toys Directive aims to create a uniform framework for toy regulation across the EU, Sweden's failure to implement the directive and the specific circumstances of the 'Bang' toy case raise questions about Big Fun's ability to rely on the directive. The directive's provisions may not be uniformly applied, and Big Fun's reliance on the directive could potentially be seen as a disguised restriction on trade if it is used to prevent the enforcement of Swedish law. Therefore, Big Fun's ability to rely on the Safe Toys Directive in this situation is uncertain and would likely depend on the specific interpretation of the directive and the principles of EU law by the Swedish courts.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","a) **Special legislative procedure**: This refers to the procedure for adopting legislation in the European Union that requires a special majority in the Council of the European Union. According to Article 289 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the special legislative procedure applies to certain areas such as the common foreign and security policy, the common security and defense policy, and the area of freedom, security and justice. In cases where a special legislative procedure is required, the Council must adopt the measure by a qualified majority, and the European Parliament must be consulted. This procedure is designed to ensure that the EU's legislative process is robust and inclusive, particularly in areas of significant political importance (European Parliament v Council of the European Union, C-130/10).

b) **Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs)**: MEQRs are rules enacted by Member States that have the same effect as quantitative restrictions on intra-Community trade. They are prohibited under Article 30 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Court of Justice has established that MEQRs can be identified by their ability to hinder, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade (Case 8/74 Dassonville [1974] ECR 837, paragraph 5; Deutscher Apothekerverband , paragraph 66; Rosengren and Others , paragraph 32; Case C‑297/05 Commission  v Netherlands  [2007] ECR I‑7467, paragraph 53; and Case C‑143/06 Ludwigs-Apotheke  [2007] ECR I‑9623, paragraph 26).

c) **Concerted practices**: Concerted practices are agreements between undertakings that have the purpose or effect of restricting competition within the common market. They are prohibited under Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Court of Justice has established that concerted practices can include agreements between undertakings, as well as practices that are not explicitly agreed upon but are nevertheless coordinated (Case 2/73 United Brands [1974] ECR 237, paragraph 11).

d) **Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings**: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are legal actions brought by the European Commission against Member States that fail to comply with EU law. These proceedings are governed by Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Commission can initiate infringement proceedings against a Member State that has failed to fulfill its obligations under EU law, and the Court of Justice can be called upon to rule on the validity of the Commission's actions (Commission v Greece).

e) **Proportionality**: Proportionality is a fundamental principle of EU law that requires measures taken by Member States to be appropriate for securing the attainment of the objective pursued and not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain it. This principle is derived from the general principles of EU law and is applied in various contexts, including the prohibition on MEQRs (Article 30 TFEU). The Court of Justice has emphasized that the proportionality principle requires a balance between the protection of the public interest and the protection of the free movement of goods within the EU (Joined Cases C‑388/00 and C‑429/00 Radiosistemi [2002] ECR I‑5845, paragraphs 40 to 42, and also Case C‑14/02 ATRAL  [2003] ECR I‑4431, paragraph 64).","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law.","a) This is not in accordance with EU law. EU law, as established in the case of 'Mouvement contre le racisme, l'antisémitisme et la xénophobie ASBL (MRAX) v Belgian State', requires Member States to grant the right of residence to EU workers regardless of the document they entered the territory with. The Belgian authorities' refusal to consider Cynthia as an EU worker due to a change in her employment situation is discriminatory and violates Article 4(3) of Directive 68/360 and Article 6 of Directive 73/148.

b) This is not in accordance with EU law. The principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, as established in the case of 'Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium', prohibits Member States from excluding EU citizens from certain jobs based on their nationality. Cynthia's application rejection for the Ministry of Higher Education job is discriminatory and violates Article 7 of the Treaty.

c) This is not in accordance with EU law. The principle of freedom of movement for workers, as established in the case of 'Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon', prohibits Member States from excluding EU citizens from jobs based on their nationality or linguistic requirements. Cynthia's application rejection for the private academy job is discriminatory and violates Article 39(1) to (3) EC.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","In resolving the EU law-related issues in the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough, the court must consider the principles of EU law, particularly the primacy of EU law over national law and the harmonization of building standards within the EU. The Safe Building Directive (2015/2016) is a key piece of EU legislation that harmonizes building standards across the Member States, including Fantasia.

Firstly, the court should examine the primacy of EU law. According to settled case-law, EU law takes precedence over national law when the two conflict (see Case 6/64, Flaminio Costa v ENEL [1964] ECR 585). In this case, the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015, entered into force on June 1, 2015, and was implemented by Fantasia through the 2016 Construction Act. The Directive's Article 20 explicitly states that Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices beyond what is laid down in Articles 5-15. Since the 1948 Law on Public Safety does not align with this directive, it is potentially in conflict with EU law.

Secondly, the court should consider the principle of harmonization. The Safe Building Directive aims to harmonize building standards across the EU, enabling trade in construction work on the internal market. The Directive's Article 1 establishes this harmonization, and Articles 5-15 detail the specific requirements for different types of buildings. The absence of a requirement for shelters in Articles 5-15 suggests that the Directive does not mandate their inclusion. However, the 1948 Law on Public Safety, which remains in effect, requires shelters in buildings designed for more than 10 people.

Given these considerations, the court should assess whether Good Enough can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive to set aside paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety. According to settled case-law, the Court may, in application of the general principle of legal certainty inherent in the Community legal order, be moved to restrict for any person concerned the opportunity of relying on a provision which it has interpreted with a view to calling in question legal relationships established in good faith (see Case C-313/05 Brzeziński [2007] ECR I-513, paragraph 56). However, this restriction can only be imposed if those concerned acted in good faith and there is a risk of serious difficulties.

In this case, Good Enough acted in good faith by not including a shelter in the building, believing that it was unnecessary and economically unrealistic. The risk of serious difficulties is also present, as the 1948 Law on Public Safety remains in effect and could potentially lead to legal consequences for Good Enough. Therefore, the court should not restrict Good Enough's opportunity to rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive.

In conclusion, the court should rule in favor of Big Money, as the 1948 Law on Public Safety remains in effect and requires the inclusion of a shelter in the building. Good Enough's reliance on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive is not sufficient to set aside the national law requirement, given the principles of EU law and harmonization. The court should order Good Enough to include a shelter in the building, as required by the 1948 Law on Public Safety, and potentially award damages to Big Money for the breach of contract.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): The ordinary legislative procedure, also known as the co-decision procedure, is a process established by Article 294 TFEU (formerly Article 251 TEC) that involves the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union working together to adopt legislative acts. This procedure is designed to ensure that the legislative process is democratic and involves the direct participation of the EU's elected representatives. The procedure is triggered when the Commission proposes a legislative act, and it requires the Council to adopt a common position, which is then subject to the approval of the European Parliament. If the Parliament and the Council cannot agree, the matter can be referred to conciliation, and if necessary, to the European Council. This process is further detailed in the judgments of the Court of Justice, such as in the case of European Parliament v Council of the European Union (C-130/10, EU:C:2012:472).

b) State liability: State liability under EU law refers to the legal responsibility of Member States for damage caused by their own acts or omissions. This concept is based on the principle of state liability established by Article 340 TFEU (formerly Article 288 TEC). The Court of Justice has developed the principles of state liability in various cases, such as in the case of Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others (C-46/93, C-48/93), which emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the Union's objectives are effectively implemented by the Member States.

c) The preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism established by Article 267 TFEU (formerly Article 234 EEC) that allows national courts to request the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to interpret EU law in specific cases. This procedure is designed to ensure consistency in the application of EU law across the Member States and to provide guidance to national courts on the interpretation of EU law. The preliminary ruling procedure is outlined in the judgment of the CJEU in the case of Pupino (C-105/03, EU:C:2005:5285), which clarifies the scope and conditions for the issuance of preliminary rulings.

d) Indirect effect: Indirect effect refers to the principle that EU law, once adopted, is directly applicable in the legal systems of the Member States. This principle is established by the Court of Justice in the case of Van Gend en Loos (C-26/62, EU:C:1963:1), which held that EU law has direct effect and can be invoked before national courts. The indirect effect of EU law means that national courts must interpret and apply EU law in a way that ensures its uniform application across the EU, even if the EU law does not explicitly confer rights on individuals. This principle is further developed in the case of Marleasing (C-106/88, EU:C:1990:226), which emphasizes the importance of the indirect effect of EU law in the context of national legal systems.

e) Subsidiarity: Subsidiarity is a principle of EU law that requires that decisions be taken at the most appropriate level, i.e., the level closest to the citizens. This principle is established by Article 5(3) TEU and is designed to ensure that the EU does not exceed its competences and that decisions are made at the level where they are most effectively implemented. The principle of subsidiarity is further developed in the judgment of the Court of Justice in the case of European Parliament v Council of the European Union (C-658/11, EU:C:2014:2025), which emphasizes the importance of ensuring that decisions are taken at the appropriate level and that the EU does not interfere with the competences of the Member States.","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,
"Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B. Juan is Spanish and lives in Madrid with his Argentine wife Carmen. The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not? (Reason as with A(i) above), yet use question B facts.) ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation? (Include whether it can bring a court proceeding against Portugal.) Your assignment: Answer each sub-question from a EU law perspective. Support your answers by referring at every opportunity during your answers when relevant references are made of sources of EU law. Make clear which sub-question you are answering. Where appropriate provide specific examples (like in math class), not simply an unexplained answer. In other words describe several steps applying the law you have learned to these facts and demonstrating your understanding of how they fit within the broader context of the EU legal system functions.","**A(i)**

The Italian public school's decision to deny Anna employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen is likely to be in breach of EU law, specifically the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality. This principle is enshrined in Article 18 TFEU and has been consistently upheld by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).

Firstly, the decision to deny employment based on nationality is a form of discrimination, which is prohibited under EU law. The CJEU has held that a measure which makes it impossible for persons established in other Member States to provide services in a Member State is a restriction on the freedom to provide services (see Case C-355/98 Commission v Belgium [2000] ECR I-1221, paragraph 27). In this context, the requirement that Anna must be an Italian citizen to be employed is a similar restriction.

Secondly, the decision interferes with Anna's right to equal treatment and non-discrimination. The CJEU has held that a measure which discriminates against EU citizens on the basis of their nationality is a breach of EU law (see Case C-404/97 Commission v Portugal [2000] ECR I-4897, paragraph 52).

The Italian public school's decision may also be seen as an obstacle to the free movement of workers, which is protected under Article 45 TFEU. The CJEU has held that such obstacles can only be justified if they are based on objective criteria and if the public interest is not already safeguarded by the rules to which the worker is subject in the Member State in which he or she is established (see Case C-514/03 Commission v Spain [2005] ECR I-07493, paragraph 43).

**A(ii)**

Anna could bring court proceedings against the decision. She could file a complaint with the Italian courts, arguing that the decision violates her rights under EU law. The Italian courts would then have to consider the case in light of EU law and, if necessary, refer the case to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling.

**B(i)**

The Portuguese authority's decision to deny Carmen a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen is likely to be in breach of EU law, specifically the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality and the right to free movement for Union citizens.

Firstly, the decision discriminates against Carmen based on her nationality, which is prohibited under EU law. The CJEU has held that a measure which discriminates against EU citizens on the basis of their nationality is a breach of EU law (see Case C-404/97 Commission v Portugal [2000] ECR I-4897, paragraph 52).

Secondly, the decision interferes with Carmen's right to free movement, which is protected under Article 20 TFEU. The CJEU has held that a Member State cannot refuse to grant a residence permit to a Union citizen's non-EU spouse on the basis of their nationality alone (see Case C-140/08 P, Commission v Portugal [2010] ECR I-00000, paragraph 50).

**B(ii)**

If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one, the Commission could bring a court proceeding against Portugal. The Commission could file an action against Portugal for failing to comply with its obligations under EU law. The case would be brought before the CJEU, which would then rule on the matter. The CJEU has held that the apprehension of internal difficulties cannot justify a failure by a Member State to comply with its obligations under EU law (see Case C-404/97 Commission v Portugal [2000] ECR I-4897, paragraph 52).","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","1) The principle that Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations is derived from the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), specifically Article 4(3) which states that ""Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that the obligations laid down by this Treaty are fulfilled."" This principle is further elaborated in cases such as 'Commission v Greece' and 'Commission v Italy' where the Court has emphasized the obligation of Member States to comply with EU directives and regulations.

2) The European Union can take formal action towards Italy if it suspects that the country is breaching Union law. The most common formal action is an infringement procedure. Under Article 258 TFEU, the Commission may bring an action in the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) against a Member State for failure to fulfill its obligations under the Treaties or EU law. If the CJEU finds that Italy has breached the directive, it may issue a formal decision ordering Italy to take the necessary measures to comply. If Italy fails to comply with the CJEU's decision, the Commission can request the CJEU to impose a financial penalty under Article 260 TFEU.

3) If the case were referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court found that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy would be required to comply with the judgement. The CJEU's decisions are binding on all Member States. If Italy does not comply with the judgement, the Commission could initiate proceedings under Article 258 TFEU to enforce the CJEU's decision. If Italy still fails to comply, the Commission could request the CJEU to impose a financial penalty under Article 260 TFEU. This process ensures that Member States are held accountable for their obligations under EU law and provides a mechanism for enforcing compliance.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,

#### a) Summary of Relevant Facts
In the case of 'Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix', the Commission of the European Communities (the Commission) brought an action against Frédéric Daffix, a French national, to challenge a decision of the French tax authorities. The dispute revolved around the tax treatment of certain income derived by Daffix from his activities as a professional musician. The Commission argued that the French tax authorities had not provided a proper statement of reasons for their decision, which was contrary to EU law.

#### b) Procedures and Courts
The case proceeded through the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The Commission initially brought an action against the French tax authorities, which was then appealed to the CJEU. The CJEU considered the case to determine whether the French tax authorities had complied with the requirements of EU law regarding the provision of reasons for decisions that adversely affect a person.

#### c) Central Legal Issue(s)
The central legal issue discussed by the CJEU was whether the decision of the French tax authorities provided a proper statement of reasons. The CJEU had to interpret and apply EU law to determine whether the decision was well-founded and whether the Commission could challenge it.

#### d) Relevant Legal Rules
The relevant legal rules were Article 253 of the EC Treaty (now Article 263 of the TFEU), which provides for the right to challenge acts of the EU institutions, and Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, which governs the requirements for applications to the Court.

#### e) Arguments and Analysis
The Commission argued that the French tax authorities had failed to provide a proper statement of reasons for their decision, which was necessary to allow the Commission to ascertain whether the decision was well-founded and to enable the Court to review its legality. The French tax authorities contended that they had provided sufficient reasons for their decision, but the Commission maintained that the reasons were insufficient and did not meet the requirements of EU law.

The CJEU analyzed the case by referring to its established case law. It noted that the requirement for a proper statement of reasons is intended to provide the person concerned with details sufficient to allow them to ascertain whether the decision is well-founded and to enable the Court to review its legality. The CJEU concluded that the French tax authorities had not provided a proper statement of reasons, as the reasons given were insufficient and did not meet the requirements of EU law.

#### f) Conclusion
The CJEU ruled in favor of the Commission, holding that the French tax authorities had failed to provide a proper statement of reasons for their decision. This decision underscored the importance of providing clear and sufficient reasons for decisions that adversely affect a person, as required by EU law.

### 2. Legal Analysis

The case of 'Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix' is significant in the general scheme of EU law for several reasons. It highlights the importance of procedural fairness and the right to a proper statement of reasons in EU decision-making processes. The decision underscores the principle that EU institutions must provide clear and sufficient reasons for their decisions to ensure that individuals can challenge and understand those decisions.

This case is particularly relevant in the context of substantive and procedural law. Substantively, it reinforces the principle that EU law requires transparency and accountability in decision-making processes. Procedurally, it emphasizes the importance of the Court of Justice's role in reviewing the legality of decisions made by EU institutions and ensuring that they comply with the requirements of EU law.

The case also touches on broader topics such as the right to an effective remedy and the principle of proportionality. The requirement for a proper statement of reasons is a key aspect of ensuring that individuals can effectively challenge decisions that affect their rights and can rely on the Court of Justice to uphold the rule of law.

In conclusion, 'Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix' is a seminal case that underscores the importance of procedural fairness and the right to a proper statement of reasons in EU law. It serves as a reminder that EU institutions must act in a transparent and accountable manner, and that individuals have the right to challenge decisions that adversely affect them.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","a) The difference between an absolute and a relative right lies in their scope and flexibility. An absolute right is an unqualified right that cannot be limited or restricted in any way. On the other hand, a relative right can be subject to limitations based on certain conditions or circumstances. In the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, an example of an absolute right is the right to life (Article 2), which cannot be infringed under any circumstances. An example of a relative right is the right to privacy (Article 7), which can be limited by law for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

b) In Case C-11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) declared that ""respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the Court of Justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community."" This decision was significant because it acknowledged the importance of fundamental rights stemming from the constitutional traditions of the Member States (MS) within the EU legal framework. The Court went in this direction for two main reasons: first, to ensure that the EU legal order was not only based on the principles of the Treaty but also on the fundamental values and rights shared by the MS. Second, it was a response to the need to provide a more robust protection of fundamental rights within the EU, which was previously lacking due to the hesitance of the Court to acknowledge such rights. This decision marked a shift in the Court's approach, moving away from a purely treaty-based interpretation and towards a more rights-based one.

c) The three principal sources of EU fundamental rights are:
1. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights: This is the primary source of EU fundamental rights. It was adopted in 2000 and is now part of the EU legal order, having been incorporated into the Treaty on European Union by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007.
2. The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR): The ECHR is a treaty that has been signed by all EU Member States. It is a source of inspiration for the EU Charter and is often referred to as a ""constitutional treaty"" in the EU context.
3. The general principles of EU law: These are principles that have been developed by the CJEU over time and are considered part of the general principles of EU law. They include principles such as the principle of proportionality, the principle of non-discrimination, and the principle of the rule of law.

These three sources are interconnected and complement each other, providing a comprehensive framework for the protection of fundamental rights within the EU legal order.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","A) The decision of the Italian authorities to refuse Maria's residence renewal on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation is not in conformity with EU law. This is primarily due to the principles of freedom of movement for workers as established in Article 39 EC (now Article 45 TFEU) and the case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).

According to Article 39 EC, freedom of movement for workers within the European Community entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration, and other conditions of work and employment. This principle is further clarified in the case of Angonese (Case C-281/98 [2000] ECR I-4139, paragraph 29), which states that workers must be treated equally regardless of their nationality.

Moreover, the ECJ has ruled that even if the rules on freedom of movement for workers are directed at ensuring that foreign nationals and companies are treated in the same way as nationals of the host Member State, they also preclude the State of origin from obstructing the freedom of one of its nationals to accept and pursue employment in another Member State (Case C-385/00 De Groot [2002] ECR I-11819, paragraph 79). This means that Maria's right to work and reside in Italy should not be affected by the reduction in her working hours.

B) Maria has other options to reside in Italy beyond being considered a privileged 'EU worker'. She could potentially rely on other provisions of EU law that provide for the right of residence for EU citizens. For instance, the EU Directive on the Right to Residence (Directive 2004/38/EC) allows EU citizens to reside in another Member State for up to five years without being employed, provided they have sufficient resources to support themselves and their family members. Additionally, the ECJ has ruled that a person who performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for remuneration must be considered a worker, and any person who pursues activities which are real and genuine is entitled to freedom of movement as a worker (Case 66/85 Lawrie-Blum [1986] ECR 2121, paragraphs 16 and 17, and Case C-138/02 Collins [2004] ECR I-2703, paragraph 26).

Therefore, Maria could argue that her 15-hour weekly work is a genuine and real activity that qualifies her as a worker, and she should be entitled to reside in Italy under the provisions of EU law.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,

When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","### Presentation of the Decision

**a) Summary of the Relevant Facts**
In the case C-561/19, Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA, the dispute revolved around the interpretation of a provision of EU law regarding the application of the principle of equal treatment in the context of public procurement. The case involved two parties: Consorzio Italian Management, representing Catania Multiservizi SpA, and Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA (RFI). The dispute was about whether RFI had correctly applied the principle of equal treatment in its public procurement process.

**b) Procedures and Courts**
The case began in the Italian courts, where the dispute was brought before the Tribunal di Roma. The Tribunal of Rome referred a question to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) under Article 267 TFEU, seeking clarification on the interpretation of EU law. The CJEU then issued its judgment on the matter.

**c) Central Legal Issue(s)**
The central legal issue was the interpretation of the principle of equal treatment in public procurement, specifically in the context of Article 101 TFEU and the relevant secondary legislation.

**d) Relevant Legal Rules**
The relevant legal rules included Article 101 TFEU, which prohibits agreements between undertakings that have the object or effect of restricting competition, and the secondary legislation implementing the principle of equal treatment in public procurement.

**e) Arguments and Analysis by the Court of Justice**
The parties argued differently on the interpretation of the principle of equal treatment. Consorzio Italian Management argued that RFI had not applied the principle correctly, leading to an unequal treatment of its company. RFI, on the other hand, maintained that its actions were in compliance with EU law. The CJEU analyzed the arguments by considering the principles of EU law and the specific provisions related to public procurement.

**f) Conclusion**
The Court of Justice concluded that RFI had indeed violated the principle of equal treatment in public procurement by not applying the principle correctly. The Court held that RFI's actions were discriminatory and thus in breach of EU law.

### Legal Analysis

**Importance of the Case in EU Law**

The case C-561/19 is significant in the general scheme of EU law for several reasons. It reinforces the principle of equal treatment in public procurement, which is a fundamental aspect of EU competition law. The judgment highlights the importance of the correct application of EU principles and rules in public procurement processes, ensuring that all participants are treated equally and fairly.

**Substantive Law**
The case is particularly relevant to the substantive area of EU competition law. It underscores the importance of the principle of equal treatment, which is a cornerstone of EU competition policy. The judgment emphasizes that public authorities must adhere to the principles of EU law when engaging in public procurement, ensuring that no entity is discriminated against.

**Procedural Law**
From a procedural perspective, the case illustrates the role of the Court of Justice in interpreting EU law. The referral of a question to the CJEU by the Italian court under Article 267 TFEU demonstrates the cooperative relationship between national courts and the CJEU. The Court's obligation to give a ruling on questions concerning the interpretation of EU law is a key aspect of this cooperation.

**Other Topics**
The case also touches on the broader topic of the application of EU law in national jurisdictions. It underscores the importance of national courts accurately applying EU law when interpreting and applying it in their own jurisdictions. This case serves as a reminder that the principle of equal treatment is not merely a theoretical concept but a practical requirement that must be adhered to in all areas of EU law, including public procurement.

In conclusion, the judgment in C-561/19 is a significant contribution to the understanding and application of EU law, particularly in the context of public procurement and the principle of equal treatment. It reinforces the importance of correct interpretation and application of EU principles and rules by national courts and public authorities.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"In the context of EU law, an ""indirect challenge of an EU act"" refers to a situation where a national court reviews the validity of an EU act, not because the act directly affects the case at hand, but because the act has implications for the national legal order. This concept is exemplified in the case of ""Commission v Greece,"" where the Greek government's failure to fulfill its obligations under EU law was indirectly challenged by the European Commission.

""National procedural autonomy"" is the principle that allows Member States to determine their own procedural rules for implementing EU law. This concept is highlighted in the case ""Commission v Italian Republic,"" where it was established that national authorities must demonstrate that their legislation addresses an essential interest or an overriding requirement relating to the general interest, and that such legislation conforms to the principle of proportionality.

The ""principle of supremacy"" is a fundamental principle of EU law that establishes that EU law takes precedence over national law. This principle ensures the uniform application and effectiveness of EU law across all Member States. The cases ""Commission v Belgium,"" ""Commission v Netherlands,"" and ""Commission v France"" all touch upon the principle of supremacy, emphasizing its role in maintaining the integrity of EU law.

A ""non-legislative EU act"" refers to measures adopted by the EU institutions that are not legislative in nature, such as regulations, decisions, recommendations, and opinions. These acts can have significant legal effects within the EU and its Member States. The cases ""Commission v Belgium,"" ""Commission v Netherlands,"" and ""Commission v France"" all involve non-legislative acts, demonstrating their importance in the EU legal framework.

The ""field of application of EU fundamental rights"" pertains to the areas where EU fundamental rights are applicable and enforceable. This concept is crucial for ensuring that EU law respects and protects fundamental rights across all Member States. The cases ""Commission v Belgium,"" ""Commission v Netherlands,"" and ""Commission v France"" all address the field of application of EU fundamental rights, highlighting their significance in the context of EU law.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","In the dispute between Happy Times and Big Fun, Big Fun's reliance on the Safe Toys Directive is not straightforward. The directive aims to harmonize the rules concerning the production, marketing, and sale of toys across the EU to facilitate trade and ensure safety. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, which means that the directive's provisions do not have direct effect in Swedish law. Therefore, Big Fun cannot directly invoke the Safe Toys Directive in Swedish courts to defend its sale of the 'Bang' toy gun.

The Swedish legislation that prohibits 'immoral or inappropriate toys', including those imitating firearms, is based on national law and has been upheld by Swedish courts for over 30 years. This national legislation is the legal basis for the ban on toys imitating firearms in Sweden, and it is not overridden by the Safe Toys Directive because Sweden has not adopted it.

The Safe Toys Directive's goal is to limit the circumstances under which a toy may be banned, stipulating that a toy may only be prohibited if it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, since Sweden has not implemented the directive, the criteria set by the directive do not apply in the Swedish legal context. Big Fun's argument that the 'Bang' toy is not obviously dangerous in normal use would need to be assessed under Swedish law, not the Safe Toys Directive.

In conclusion, Big Fun cannot rely on the Safe Toys Directive in the Swedish court case brought by Happy Times. The case will be decided based on Swedish national law, which currently prohibits toys imitating firearms. Big Fun's defense would need to address the specific provisions of Swedish law that apply to the sale of the 'Bang' toy gun.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","In the context of EU law, several key terms and concepts are fundamental to understanding the legal framework and the Court's jurisprudence. These include the special legislative procedure, measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), concerted practices, enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, and proportionality.

a) Special legislative procedure: This term refers to a specific process outlined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) for the adoption of certain types of legislation. It is designed to ensure that certain areas of EU law, such as those affecting the internal market, are adopted with a high degree of scrutiny and involvement from the European Parliament. The special legislative procedure is detailed in Article 294 TFEU and is applicable to a range of legislative acts, including those that establish or amend the rules governing the internal market. The Court has clarified that the legal basis of a measure, rather than the procedures followed, determines the applicable legislative procedure (European Parliament v Council of the European Union, Case C-130/10, EU:C:2012:472, paragraph 80).

b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs): MEQRs are provisions in national law that, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, hinder intra-Community trade. They are prohibited under Article 28 EC, which aims to ensure the free movement of goods within the EU. The Court has established that any national legislation capable of hindering trade, whether directly or indirectly, falls within this prohibition (Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany, Case 8/74 Dassonville [1974] ECR 837, paragraph 5). The Court has also stated that the prohibition of MEQRs covers all rules enacted by Member States that can hinder trade (Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany, Case C-143/06 Ludwigs-Apotheke [2007] ECR I‑9623, paragraph 26).

c) Concerted practices: Concerted practices refer to a form of anti-competitive behavior where companies in the same market collaborate to fix prices, limit production, or divide markets among themselves. This practice is prohibited under Article 101 TFEU, which aims to prevent anti-competitive agreements and practices that could distort the internal market. The Court has held that concerted practices can be established through a combination of objective and subjective elements, including the similarity of the products or services, the market structure, and the behavior of the companies involved (Joined Cases C-234/89 and C-8/90 Poucet and Pistre [1992] ECR I‑4165).

d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: These are legal actions taken by the European Commission to ensure that EU law is properly applied and enforced by Member States. Infringement proceedings are initiated when a Member State is suspected of failing to fulfill its obligations under EU law, such as by implementing or applying national legislation that contravenes EU rules (Commission v Greece, Case 267/81 Commission v Greece [1982] ECR 341). Enforcement actions can also involve the Commission taking steps to address breaches of EU law, which may include issuing fines or other penalties.

e) Proportionality: The principle of proportionality is a fundamental aspect of EU law, requiring that any action taken by the EU or its Member States must be appropriate, necessary, and not excessively burdensome in relation to the objective pursued. This principle is enshrined in Article 5 TEU and is applied across various areas of EU law, including competition law and the internal market. The Court has emphasized that national measures justifying restrictions on the free movement of goods must be appropriate for securing the attainment of the objective pursued and must not go beyond what is necessary to attain it (Commission v Italy, Case C-270/02, and Commission v Finland, Case C-54/05, ECR I‑1559 and I‑0000, paragraphs 21 and 38, respectively).","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law.","In the hypothetical scenario involving Cynthia, a French national residing in Belgium, her situation touches upon several aspects of EU law as interpreted in the provided case contexts.

a) Regarding Cynthia's employment as a chemistry lecturer, the Belgian authorities' decision to consider her no longer an ""EU worker"" due to a reduction in her working hours may not align with EU law. In ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium,"" the Court held that legislation which limits the financing of vocational higher education establishments, thereby excluding students from other Member States once a quota is reached, constitutes discrimination on grounds of nationality, which is prohibited under Article 7 of the Treaty. Although Cynthia's case does not directly involve discrimination against students, the principle that EU workers should not face discrimination based on nationality could be analogously applied. The reduction in working hours does not necessarily equate to a change in her status as an EU worker, especially since she was initially employed in a full-time capacity as a lecturer, which is a role that typically falls under the category of an EU worker.

b) Cynthia's rejection from a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media solely based on her non-Belgian citizenship is not in accordance with EU law. The Court has consistently held that while Member States can apply their legislation or collective labour agreements to any person employed, even temporarily, this is subject to the condition that the workers do not already enjoy the same protection or essentially comparable protection by virtue of obligations to which their employer is subject in the Member State in which it is established (as seen in ""Commission of the European Communities v Grand Duchy of Luxemburg""). Since Cynthia is already employed in Belgium, she should be entitled to the same rights and protections as Belgian citizens, including the right to work in public service positions.

c) The rejection of Cynthia's application for a job at a private academy as a tutor due to her non-Belgian citizenship and failure to meet linguistic requirements may also be in conflict with EU law. While Member States have the right to set certain conditions for employment, these must not be discriminatory or unjustifiably restrictive. The Court has held that the right of every citizen of the Union to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States includes the right to work (as stated in ""Government of the French Community and Walloon Government v Flemish Government""). However, the linguistic requirements could be justified if they are necessary for the job and are applied equally to all applicants, regardless of nationality. If the linguistic requirements are excessively restrictive and not justified by the needs of the job, they could be seen as a barrier to the free movement of workers, which is a fundamental principle of EU law.

In summary, while Member States have some discretion in setting employment conditions, these must not result in unjustified discrimination or barriers to the free movement of workers within the EU. Cynthia's situation raises questions about the proportionality and justification of the Belgian authorities' decisions, which would need to be assessed in light of the relevant EU legal principles and case law.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","In resolving the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough, I would first consider the relevant EU law and the principles established by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the cases cited in the provided context. The key issues at hand are the interpretation of the contract terms in light of national legislation and EU directives, and the application of the principle of legal certainty.

The contract between Good Enough and Big Money stipulates that the building should be constructed ""in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019"". At that time, the 1948 Law on Public Safety was still in effect, which requires the inclusion of a shelter in buildings designed for more than 10 people. Good Enough's failure to include a shelter in the construction of Big Money's headquarters is a clear breach of this national legislation.

However, Good Enough argues that the Safe Building Directive, which harmonizes building standards across the EU, should take precedence. Article 20 of the Directive explicitly states that Member States may not introduce any further requirements beyond those laid down in Articles 5-15, which do not mention shelters. Since Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, and the 1948 Law on Public Safety was not repealed, Good Enough's argument hinges on the interpretation of the Directive's relationship with national law.

The CJEU has established that EU directives must be transposed into national law by the deadline set by the Directive, which in this case was December 31, 2016. Fantasia complied with this deadline by adopting the 2016 Construction Act, which incorporated Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive into national law. However, the CJEU has also held that national law must be interpreted in light of EU law, and where there is a conflict, EU law prevails (see Case C-293/2007 Commission v Germany, paragraph 51).

In this case, the 1948 Law on Public Safety and Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive appear to be in conflict. The CJEU has ruled that national law must be interpreted consistently with EU law (see Case C-293/2007, paragraph 52). Therefore, even though the 1948 Law on Public Safety was not repealed, it must be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the Safe Building Directive.

Given this legal framework, I would rule that Good Enough is in breach of contract for failing to include a shelter in the building, as required by the 1948 Law on Public Safety. However, I would also consider the possibility that the 1948 Law on Public Safety may have been misinterpreted or misapplied in this case. If it can be demonstrated that the shelter requirement was not intended to apply to buildings like Big Money's headquarters, or that the requirement is incompatible with the Safe Building Directive, then Good Enough may not be in breach of contract.

In conclusion, while Good Enough's argument regarding the Safe Building Directive is compelling, the national legislation in force at the time of the contract's signing remains a critical factor. As a judge, I would carefully examine the intent and application of both the national law and the EU directive to determine whether Good Enough's construction practices were indeed in breach of contract. If the shelter requirement is found to be a mandatory provision of the 1948 Law on Public Safety, Good Enough would be liable for damages to Big Money. However, if the requirement is found to be incompatible with the Safe Building Directive, the case may be resolved in favor of Good Enough.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) is a key process in the EU legislative framework, which involves both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in the adoption of legislation. This procedure is designed to ensure that both institutions have a say in the legislative process, reflecting the principle of democratic legitimacy. The OLP is governed by Article 294 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which outlines the steps for the adoption of EU legislation, including the proposal, reading, and adoption stages. The case of ""European Parliament v Council of the European Union"" (C‑658/11, EU:C:2014:2025, paragraph 57) highlights the importance of the legal basis of a measure in determining the procedures to be followed in adopting that measure, which is a fundamental aspect of the OLP.

b) State liability refers to the principle that Member States are liable for damages caused to individuals by breaches of EU law. This principle is enshrined in Article 268 TFEU and was further developed in the case of ""Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others."" This case established that Member States could be held liable for damages resulting from the failure to comply with EU law, provided that the breach was sufficiently serious and directly linked to the damage suffered by the claimant.

c) The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism that allows national courts to refer questions concerning the interpretation or validity of EU law to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). This procedure is crucial for ensuring the uniform interpretation and application of EU law across Member States. Article 267 TFEU governs this procedure, and it is highlighted in the case of ""European Commission v Republic of Austria"" (paragraph 82), where the assessment of the concept of 'exercise of official authority' within the meaning of Article 45 EC was considered. This case underscores the importance of the preliminary ruling procedure in maintaining the effectiveness of EU law.

d) Indirect effect is a principle that allows national courts to interpret domestic law in a manner that is consistent with EU law, even when EU law does not directly apply. This principle is based on the idea that EU law should prevail over conflicting national law, ensuring the effectiveness of EU law. The case of ""Reyners"" (paragraph 50) illustrates the application of this principle, emphasizing the need to interpret national law in a way that aligns with the limits imposed by EU law on the principle of freedom of establishment.

e) Subsidiarity is a principle that ensures that decisions are made as closely as possible to the citizens and that the EU does not take action unless it is more effective than action taken at national, regional, or local levels. This principle is outlined in Article 5(3) TEU and is designed to respect the diversity of Member States and their ability to address issues at a more appropriate level. The case of ""Opinion 2/94"" (paragraph 29) discusses the role of subsidiarity in determining when the Community institutions have the necessary powers to act, highlighting its importance in the EU legislative process.","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,
"Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B. Juan is Spanish and lives in Madrid with his Argentine wife Carmen. The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not? (Reason as with A(i) above), yet use question B facts.) ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation? (Include whether it can bring a court proceeding against Portugal.) Your assignment: Answer each sub-question from a EU law perspective. Support your answers by referring at every opportunity during your answers when relevant references are made of sources of EU law. Make clear which sub-question you are answering. Where appropriate provide specific examples (like in math class), not simply an unexplained answer. In other words describe several steps applying the law you have learned to these facts and demonstrating your understanding of how they fit within the broader context of the EU legal system functions.","A(i) The Italian public school's decision to deny employment to Anna, a Swedish citizen, based on her non-Italian citizenship, is not in conformity with EU law. The principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality is enshrined in EU law, specifically in Article 18 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This principle prohibits any discrimination based on nationality within the scope of the Treaty's provisions. In the case of 'Commission v Italy' (Case C-355/98), the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) held that the freedom to provide services, which includes the freedom to work, is a fundamental right within the EU. The Italian school's decision interferes with Anna's right to work and is therefore a breach of EU law. The school could only justify this interference if it were necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate aim, such as public policy, public security, or public health. However, the CJEU has established that such justifications must not be used as a pretext for discrimination (Case C-514/03 Commission v Spain, paragraph 43). In this scenario, the Italian school's justification would likely not be considered necessary or proportionate, as the right to work is a fundamental freedom within the EU, and there is no indication that Anna's employment would pose a threat to public policy, security, or health.

A(ii) Anna may have remedies available to her. She can bring court proceedings against the decision, as the CJEU has confirmed that individuals have the right to bring actions before national courts against acts of EU institutions or Member States that are alleged to breach EU law (Case C-289/94 Commission v Italy, paragraph 20). Anna could bring her case before the national courts of Italy, arguing that the school's decision is a breach of EU law, specifically the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality and the freedom to provide services. If the national courts find in Anna's favor, they can annul the school's decision and order the school to comply with EU law.

B(i) The Portuguese authority's decision to deny Carmen, a non-Union citizen, a residence permit is not in conformity with EU law. The right of entry into the territory of a Member State for family members of EU citizens is a fundamental right under EU law, as established in the case of 'MRAX' (Case C-355/98 Commission v Belgium, paragraph 74). The CJEU has held that the right of entry for family members is based on the family relationship alone and is not dependent on the third-country national's nationality. Therefore, the Portuguese authority's decision to deny Carmen a residence permit solely because she is not a Union citizen is a breach of EU law. The Portuguese authority could only justify this interference if it were necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate aim, such as public policy, public security, or public health. However, the CJEU has emphasized that such justifications must not be used as a pretext for discrimination (Case C-404/00 Commission v Spain, paragraph 55). In this case, the Portuguese authority's justification would likely not be considered necessary or proportionate, as the right of entry for family members is a fundamental right within the EU.

B(ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits to non-Union citizens like Carmen, it could bring a court proceeding against Portugal at the EU level. The CJEU has confirmed that individuals have the right to bring actions before national courts against acts of Member States that are alleged to breach EU law (Case C-289/94 Commission v Italy, paragraph 20). Additionally, the European Commission, which is responsible for ensuring the application of EU law, can initiate infringement proceedings against Member States that fail to comply with their obligations under EU law. In this case, the Commission could investigate and potentially bring an infringement action against Portugal for failing to comply with its obligations under EU law regarding the right of entry for family members of EU citizens. If the Commission finds that Portugal is in breach of EU law, it can refer the case to the CJEU, which can impose penalties or require Portugal to take corrective action.","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","In the context of the new Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, the Member States, including Italy, have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations as stipulated in the Treaties. Specifically, Article 4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) outlines the obligations of Member States to comply with EU law, which includes directives such as Directive (EU) 2016/2284. This article mandates that Member States must take the necessary measures to ensure that their national laws and practices are in line with EU directives and regulations.

If the European Union suspects that Italy is breaching Union law, particularly in failing to report the required emissions data as mandated by Article 9 and Article 10.4 of Directive (EU) 2016/2284, the European Union can take formal action towards Italy. One of the formal actions available to the European Union is to initiate infringement proceedings against Italy. This process begins with the European Commission sending a formal notice to Italy, outlining the alleged breach of EU law and requesting that Italy take the necessary steps to comply with the directive. If Italy fails to respond adequately or rectify the breach, the Commission can then refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).

Should the CJEU find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, specifically under Directive (EU) 2016/2284, Italy would be required to comply with the Court's judgment. If Italy does not comply with the judgment, the CJEU can impose financial penalties on Italy. These penalties are designed to ensure that Member States fulfill their obligations under EU law. The amount of the fine is determined by the Court based on the severity of the breach and the length of time the breach has continued. The imposition of fines serves as a deterrent against non-compliance and underscores the importance of adhering to EU law.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,
"1. Present the decision of the case. This presentation should include, in your own words (only highlighting text in the judgment won't give points), a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","In the case of ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix,"" the central legal issue revolved around the adequacy of the reasons provided by the contested decision, which adversely affected Mr. Daffix. The dispute arose when Mr. Daffix challenged the decision made by the Commission, which he believed lacked sufficient reasoning to understand the basis of the decision and to enable him to ascertain whether the decision was well-founded and to enable the Court to review its legality.

The procedures that occurred in the Court of Justice began with Mr. Daffix's application, which was scrutinized under Article 35 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice. The Court examined whether the statement of reasons provided by the Commission was clear and precise enough to allow Mr. Daffix to understand the decision and to enable the Court to review its legality. The Court of Justice considered previous case-law, such as ""Michel v Parliament,"" ""Lux v Court of Auditors,"" and ""Pérez-Mínguez Casariego v Commission,"" which emphasized the importance of providing reasons for decisions that adversely affect individuals.

The relevant legal rules in this case were derived from the aforementioned case-law, which established that a proper statement of reasons is necessary for the decision to be well-founded and for the Court to exercise its power of review. The Court of Justice analyzed whether the Commission had complied with these requirements by providing a statement of reasons that was sufficiently clear and precise.

In its conclusion, the Court of Justice found that the Commission had failed to provide a proper statement of reasons in its decision against Mr. Daffix. The Court held that the reasons given were not clear and precise enough to enable Mr. Daffix to understand the decision and to allow the Court to review its legality. As a result, the Court ruled that the decision was not well-founded and ordered the Commission to provide a proper statement of reasons.

The importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law lies in its reinforcement of the principle that decisions made by EU institutions must be accompanied by a clear and precise statement of reasons. This principle is crucial for ensuring transparency, accountability, and the rule of law within the EU legal system. It also underscores the Court of Justice's role in reviewing the legality of decisions and ensuring that individuals' rights are protected. The case serves as a reminder of the procedural obligations of EU institutions and the rights of individuals to understand the basis of decisions that affect them.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","In the context of EU law, fundamental rights are considered to be an integral part of the general principles of law that the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ensures. These rights are derived from various sources, including the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, international treaties for the protection of human rights, and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights itself. The distinction between absolute and relative rights is significant in this framework. Absolute rights are those that cannot be restricted under any circumstances, while relative rights can be limited under certain conditions, provided that the limitations are justified and proportionate.

An example of an absolute right from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is the right to life (Article 2). This right cannot be restricted under any circumstances. On the other hand, an example of a relative right is the right to freedom of expression (Article 11), which can be limited to protect the rights of others, national security, territorial integrity, public safety, health, or morals, or to protect the reputation or rights of others.

In the case of 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU took a significant step by declaring that respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the Court of Justice. This declaration marked a departure from the Court's previous hesitancy to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming directly from the Member States' constitutional laws. Two reasons for this shift include:

1. The increasing importance of fundamental rights within the EU legal order, as evidenced by the growing number of cases brought before the Court that involved fundamental rights issues. This trend underscored the need for a clear and consistent approach to the protection of fundamental rights within the EU framework.

2. The influence of international human rights instruments, such as the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which had already established a strong precedent for the protection of fundamental rights. The CJEU recognized the need to align its approach with these international standards to ensure the effective protection of fundamental rights within the EU.

The three principal sources of EU fundamental rights, often referred to as the ""bill of rights,"" are:

1. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is directly applicable in all EU Member States and in the EU's institutions (Article 6 TEU).
2. The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which the EU has acceded to and which has influenced the development of EU law (Article 6 TEU).
3. The constitutional traditions common to the Member States, which provide a historical and cultural foundation for the protection of fundamental rights within the EU (Article 6 TEU).

These sources are stated in the Treaty on European Union (TEU), specifically in Article 6, which outlines the basis for the protection of fundamental rights within the EU legal order.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","A) The decision to refuse Maria's renewal of residence on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation does not conform with EU law. According to the case of 'Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic' (Case C-482/01 and C-493/01), the right of residence for a Portuguese national in Italy is subject to the condition that the person remains a worker or, where relevant, a person seeking employment. The Court clarified that the right of residence is not limited to those who are gainfully employed full-time but extends to those who are engaged in genuine and real activities, even if they are part-time or have reduced working hours. Maria's part-time work as a science teacher, albeit reduced, still constitutes a gainful occupation, and therefore, her right to reside in Italy should not be denied solely based on the number of hours she works.

B) Beyond being a 'EU worker', Maria may still have the option to reside in Italy under other provisions of Community law. The case of 'Commission of the European Communities v Portuguese Republic' (Case C-385/00) established that the freedom of movement for workers includes the right to seek employment in another Member State without being obstructed by the State of origin. If Maria's part-time work is insufficient to meet her needs, she could potentially seek employment in another Member State, which would allow her to exercise her right to freedom of movement. Additionally, the case of 'Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Denmark' (Case C-482/01 and C-493/01) indicates that a person who performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for remuneration is considered a worker. If Maria's part-time work is deemed to be a genuine and real activity, she may be entitled to certain rights as a worker, which could include the right to reside in Italy. However, the specific circumstances of her case would need to be examined in light of the relevant provisions of Community law.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,
"Throughout the course you have been trained in reading and analysing the case law of the European Court of Justice. Below is a judgment of the European Court of Justice, C-561/19, Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA Your assignment: 1. Present the decision of the case (7 p.). This presentation should include, in your own words, a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","In the case of Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) dealt with a dispute concerning the interpretation of EU law, specifically Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007, which pertains to the common rules on railway infrastructure charges. The parties involved were Consorzio Italian Management, a consortium of railway undertakings, and Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA, the company responsible for managing the Italian railway infrastructure.

The dispute arose when Consorzio Italian Management challenged the charges imposed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA, arguing that the charges were not in accordance with EU law. The case progressed through the Italian courts, which initially ruled in favor of Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA. Dissatisfied with this decision, Consorzio Italian Management sought a preliminary ruling from the ECJ to clarify the interpretation of the relevant EU law provisions.

The central legal issue discussed by the ECJ was whether the charges imposed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA complied with the requirements of Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007. The Court of Justice had to determine if the charges were proportionate, transparent, and non-discriminatory, as required by the regulation.

The relevant legal rules in question were the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007, which set out the common rules on railway infrastructure charges within the EU. The regulation aimed to ensure that charges were fair, transparent, and based on the actual costs incurred by the infrastructure manager.

In its analysis, the ECJ examined the arguments presented by both parties. Consorzio Italian Management argued that the charges were excessive and not justified by the actual costs incurred by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA. On the other hand, Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA contended that the charges were in line with the regulation and reflected the costs of managing the railway infrastructure.

The ECJ concluded that the charges imposed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA did not comply with the requirements of Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007. The Court found that the charges were not proportionate and transparent, and therefore, the Italian courts should reconsider their decision in light of the ECJ's interpretation of the regulation.

The importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law lies in its clarification of the principles governing railway infrastructure charges within the EU. It reinforces the need for charges to be fair, transparent, and based on actual costs, ensuring that they do not distort competition or create barriers to the internal market. This case also highlights the role of the ECJ in interpreting EU law and providing guidance to national courts, ensuring uniform application of EU law across member states.

The judgment in this case is consistent with the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination that are central to EU law. It also emphasizes the importance of transparency in the imposition of charges, which is crucial for maintaining trust in the EU's single market. The case serves as a reminder of the responsibilities of infrastructure managers and the need for them to justify their charges in accordance with EU law.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights," In the context provided, several EU law terms and concepts are implicitly addressed through the case law references and the principles discussed. The concept of 'indirect challenge of an EU act' can be inferred from the cases such as ""Commission v Greece"" and ""Commission v Portugal,"" where the European Commission challenges national measures that may indirectly affect the application of EU law, particularly the freedom of establishment under Article 45 EC. National procedural autonomy is highlighted in ""Commission v Italian Republic,"" where it is emphasized that competent national authorities must demonstrate that their legislation serves an essential interest or an overriding requirement in the general interest, while also adhering to the principle of proportionality.

The principle of supremacy is a cornerstone of EU law, ensuring that EU law takes precedence over conflicting national law. This principle is reflected in the cases mentioned, where the assessment of the 'exercise of official authority' must consider the limits imposed by EU law on exceptions to the freedom of establishment, to prevent the effectiveness of the Treaty from being frustrated by unilateral national provisions.

A non-legislative EU act refers to actions taken by EU institutions that do not have the form of legislation, such as recommendations or opinions. While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the concept is relevant to the discussion of the Commission's role in ensuring the proper implementation of EU law, as seen in ""Commission of the European Communities v European Parliament and Council of the European Union.""

Lastly, the field of application of EU fundamental rights is demonstrated in the cases cited, where the limits on the freedom of establishment are assessed in light of the character as EU law, ensuring that the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaty are not undermined by national measures. This concept is crucial in maintaining the uniform application and effectiveness of EU law across all Member States.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above."," In the dispute between Happy Times and Big Fun, the latter may attempt to rely on the Safe Toys Directive to argue that the sale of the 'Bang' toy gun is protected under EU law. The Safe Toys Directive, as a maximum harmonization act, aims to standardize the rules for the production, marketing, and sale of toys across Member States, with the intention of facilitating trade and ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market. According to the directive, a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. Big Fun could argue that the 'Bang' toy gun, which shoots water, does not pose an obvious danger in normal use and thus should not be subject to the Swedish ban on toys imitating firearms.

However, the Swedish legislation prohibiting 'immoral or inappropriate toys' has been upheld by Swedish courts for over 30 years, and the Safe Toys Directive has not been implemented by Sweden despite the expiration of the implementation period. This raises the question of whether the Swedish ban on toys imitating firearms can be considered a disguised restriction on trade between Member States, as prohibited by Article 30 of the Treaty. In the case of ""Boehringer Ingelheim KG, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG, Glaxo Group Ltd, The Wellcome Foundation Ltd, SmithKline Beecham plc, Beecham Group plc, SmithKline & French Laboratories Ltd and Eli Lilly and Co. v Swingward Ltd and Dowelhurst Ltd,"" the Court held that the derogation from free movement of goods resulting from a trade mark proprietor's opposition to repackaging cannot be accepted if it constitutes a disguised restriction on trade between Member States.

In the case of ""Adam Opel AG v Autec AG,"" the Court ruled that the affixing of a sign identical to a trade mark registered for toys to scale models of vehicles cannot be prohibited under Article 5(1)(a) of the directive unless it affects or is liable to affect the functions of that trade mark. Big Fun could argue that the 'Bang' toy gun does not infringe on any trade mark held by Happy Times and that the Swedish ban on toys imitating firearms is a disguised restriction on trade between Member States.

However, the Swedish courts have consistently upheld the ban on toys imitating firearms, and the Safe Toys Directive has not been implemented by Sweden. It remains to be seen whether the Swedish courts will consider the Safe Toys Directive in their decision, and whether Big Fun can successfully argue that the ban on the 'Bang' toy gun constitutes a disguised restriction on trade between Member States. Ultimately, the outcome of the case will depend on the interpretation of the Safe Toys Directive and its relationship to Swedish law, as well as the specific facts of the case.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality"," a) Special legislative procedure refers to a decision-making process within the EU where the European Parliament has a more limited role compared to the Council of the European Union. In this procedure, the Council alone adopts legislation based on a proposal from the European Commission, often after consulting the Parliament. The legal basis for this procedure is typically found in the Treaties, such as Article 294 TFEU.

b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs) are national laws or regulations that, while not directly imposing quantitative restrictions on imports or exports, may nonetheless hinder intra-Community trade. The concept of MEQRs is derived from the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), particularly the landmark case ""Dassonville"" (Case 8/74). In this case, the Court established that any measure capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade falls within the scope of Article 28 EC (now Article 34 TFEU).

c) Concerted practices refer to coordinated actions between undertakings that, without being formal agreements, may restrict competition within the internal market. This concept is based on Article 101 TFEU, which prohibits agreements, decisions, and concerted practices that may affect trade between Member States and have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction, or distortion of competition within the internal market.

d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings are legal procedures initiated by the European Commission against Member States or undertakings that are suspected of violating EU law. These proceedings are governed by Articles 258-260 TFEU and aim to ensure the uniform application and enforcement of EU law across all Member States. Infringement proceedings can lead to the imposition of financial penalties on the infringing party.

e) Proportionality is a fundamental principle of EU law that requires that any action taken by EU institutions or Member States must be appropriate and necessary to achieve a legitimate objective, and must not go beyond what is necessary to attain that objective. This principle is derived from the general principles of EU law and is applied in various contexts, such as the assessment of the legality of EU measures, the interpretation of EU law, and the review of national measures that may affect the internal market. The principle of proportionality is particularly relevant in the context of MEQRs, as Member States may justify such measures on the grounds of public interest or imperative requirements, provided that they are proportionate to the objective pursued (see, for example, Case C-270/02 Commission v Italy).","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law."," a) According to EU law, Cynthia's situation may not align with the principles established in the ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium"" case. The Belgian authorities' decision to consider her no longer an ""EU worker"" due to a reduction in her working hours could potentially be seen as a restriction on the free movement of workers within the EU. EU law, particularly Directive 68/360 and Directive 73/148, emphasizes the right of EU workers to reside and work in other Member States, regardless of their employment status. Therefore, the Belgian authorities' stance may not be in accordance with EU law.

b) The rejection of Cynthia's application for a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, based on her not being a Belgian citizen, may be considered discriminatory under EU law. The ""Commission of the European Communities v Grand Duchy of Luxemburg"" case highlights that workers temporarily employed in a host Member State should not be denied the same protection or comparable protection as workers in the Member State where the employer is established. As a French national, Cynthia should be entitled to the same rights and opportunities as Belgian citizens in the context of employment in the public sector.

c) The rejection of Cynthia's application for a job at a private academy due to her not being a Belgian citizen and not meeting the linguistic requirements may be in accordance with EU law. The ""Government of the French Community and Walloon Government v Flemish Government"" case clarifies that EU citizenship does not extend the material scope of the Treaty to internal situations without a link to Community law. In this case, the linguistic requirements for the job may be considered a legitimate requirement, as the academy serves a diverse student population, including exchange students who may need classes in their native languages. Therefore, the rejection of Cynthia's application may be justified under EU law.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?"," In resolving the EU law-related issues in the case between Big Money and Good Enough, I would first consider the principles established in the cases ""Kingdom of Spain v Commission of the European Communities"" and ""Italian Republic v Commission of the European Communities."" These cases emphasize that the reasons for a decision must be considered adequate if the Member State, in this case Fantasia, was closely involved in the decision-making process and was aware of the reasons why the Commission considered that it was not required to charge the sum in dispute to the EAGGF.

In the present case, the Safe Building Directive adopted by the European Union in 2015 aims to harmonize building standards in the Member States, enabling trade in construction work on the internal market. Article 20 of the directive states that Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15. Since Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type, it can be argued that the 1948 Law on Public Safety, which requires shelters in buildings designed for more than 10 people, is an additional requirement that Fantasia should not have maintained.

However, it is essential to consider the principle of legal certainty, as established in ""Belgische Staat v Cobelfret NV."" According to this principle, the Court may restrict the opportunity of relying on a provision if those concerned have acted in good faith and if there is a risk of serious difficulties. In this case, Good Enough has acted in good faith, believing that the Safe Building Directive superseded the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Furthermore, the fact that the 1948 Law was not repealed and remained in effect on January 1, 2019, indicates that there was no clear indication that the law was no longer applicable.

In conclusion, as a judge in this case, I would rule in favor of Good Enough, considering the principles of the Safe Building Directive and the principle of legal certainty. The 1948 Law on Public Safety should be set aside in this case, as it imposes an additional requirement that is not in line with the harmonization of building standards in the EU. However, it is crucial to emphasize that this ruling is specific to the circumstances of this case and does not imply that the 1948 Law on Public Safety is entirely invalid or inapplicable in other situations.","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity"," a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) is a legislative process that involves the joint adoption of legislation by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. It is the main legislative procedure used in the EU and is designed to ensure democratic legitimacy and equal representation of Member States. The OLP is established by Article 294 TFEU and has been applied in various cases, such as European Parliament v Council of the European Union (C-130/10, EU:C:2012:472).

b) State liability refers to the legal responsibility of a Member State for damages caused to individuals or entities due to breaches of EU law. This principle is derived from the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), particularly the landmark cases Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others (C-46/93 and C-48/93, EU:C:1996:79). The CJEU has established that Member States can be held liable for damages if three conditions are met: the rule of law infringed must be intended to confer rights on individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious, and there must be a direct causal link between the breach and the damage suffered.

c) The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism that allows national courts to refer questions of EU law to the CJEU for interpretation. This procedure is established by Article 267 TFEU and aims to ensure the uniform interpretation and application of EU law across all Member States. The CJEU's rulings in preliminary rulings are binding on the referring national court and have a direct effect on the case at hand.

d) Indirect effect is a principle that requires national courts to interpret national law in a manner consistent with EU law, even if the relevant EU law provision does not have direct effect. This principle is derived from the case law of the CJEU, particularly the case of Von Colson and Kamann v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen (C-14/83, EU:C:1984:153). The CJEU has held that national courts must interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the relevant EU law provision, and must do so as far as possible.

e) Subsidiarity is a principle that governs the exercise of competences between the EU and its Member States. It is established by Article 5(3) TEU and requires that the EU only acts when the objectives of a proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone, and can be better achieved at the EU level. The principle of subsidiarity is intended to ensure that decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizens and that the EU does not interfere unnecessarily in the affairs of the Member States.","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,
"Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B. Juan is Spanish and lives in Madrid with his Argentine wife Carmen. The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not? (Reason as with A(i) above), yet use question B facts.) ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation? (Include whether it can bring a court proceeding against Portugal.) Your assignment: Answer each sub-question from a EU law perspective. Support your answers by referring at every opportunity during your answers when relevant references are made of sources of EU law. Make clear which sub-question you are answering. Where appropriate provide specific examples (like in math class), not simply an unexplained answer. In other words describe several steps applying the law you have learned to these facts and demonstrating your understanding of how they fit within the broader context of the EU legal system functions."," i) The Italian public school's decision to deny employment to Anna, a Swedish citizen, based on her nationality is not in conformity with EU law. According to the principles established in ""Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic,"" such a distinction based on residence, which in this case is linked to nationality, is liable to operate mainly to the detriment of nationals of other Member States (paragraph 14). The EU law emphasizes non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, and the Italian company's requirement for an Italian school diploma as a condition for employment interferes with this right. The justification for such a measure would need to be assessed under the criteria that the public interest relied on is not already safeguarded by the rules to which the service provider is subject in the Member State in which it is established (paragraph 62). However, given that Anna is a Swedish citizen and the requirement is based on nationality, it is unlikely that this justification would hold.

ii) Anna may have several remedies available to her under EU law. She can bring court proceedings against the Italian company's decision, as it violates the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality. The legal authority for such proceedings would be the national courts of Italy, which are required to ensure the full effectiveness of EU law (paragraph 78). The national courts would need to apply the relevant EU law principles and ensure that Anna's rights are protected.

B: i) The Portuguese authority's decision to deny a residence permit to Carmen, the Argentine wife of a Spanish citizen, is not in conformity with EU law. According to the principles established in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Spain,"" the right of entry into the territory of a Member State granted to a third-country national who is the spouse of a national of a Member State derives from the family relationship alone (paragraph 28). The issuance of a residence permit to a third-country national who is the spouse of a Member State national is to be regarded not as a measure giving rise to rights but as a measure by a Member State serving to prove the individual position of a national of a third country with regard to provisions of Community law. Therefore, the Portuguese authority's decision to deny Carmen a residence permit based on her non-Union citizenship is not in line with EU law.

ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one, the EU can take action to remedy the situation. The Commission of the European Communities can bring a court proceeding against Portugal for failing to fulfill its obligations under EU law (paragraph 78). The Court of Justice of the European Union would then assess whether Portugal has indeed failed to fulfill its obligations and, if so, issue a judgment requiring Portugal to comply with EU law. This would ensure that the rights of third-country nationals who are the spouses of EU citizens are protected and that Member States fulfill their obligations under EU law.","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?"," 1) The principle that Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations is enshrined in Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), which states that ""Member States shall take all appropriate measures, general or particular, to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations arising out of this Treaty or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union.""

2) If the European Union suspects that Italy is breaching Union law, it can initiate infringement proceedings against the country under Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The European Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, would first send a letter of formal notice to Italy, giving it the opportunity to submit its observations on the alleged breach. If the Commission is not satisfied with Italy's response, it may issue a reasoned opinion, which is a formal request for Italy to comply with EU law within a specified period. If Italy still fails to comply, the Commission may refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).

3) If the CJEU finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, and Italy does not comply with the judgement, the Commission may bring a further action for a lump sum or penalty payment under Article 260(3) TFEU. The amount of the penalty is determined by the Court, taking into account the duration and gravity of the infringement, as well as Italy's ability to pay. The purpose of the penalty is to encourage compliance with EU law and to deter future infringements.","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,

When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate."," In the case of ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix,"" the dispute revolved around the Commission's contention that Daffix, a French national, had not fulfilled his obligations as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). The case reached the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) after Daffix challenged a decision by the European Parliament that had imposed disciplinary measures against him. The central legal issue concerned the adequacy of the reasons provided by the Parliament for its decision, as required by Article 253 EC (now Article 296 TFEU).

The procedural history began with the Parliament's decision, which was then appealed by Daffix to the Court of First Instance (CFI). The CFI upheld the Parliament's decision, prompting Daffix to appeal to the CJEU. The CJEU's role was to assess whether the reasons provided by the Parliament were sufficient to enable Daffix to understand the grounds for the disciplinary measures and to allow the Court to exercise its power of review.

The relevant legal rules included Article 253 EC, which requires that decisions of EU institutions be accompanied by a statement of reasons. The Court of Justice analyzed the statement of reasons provided by the Parliament and concluded that it was not sufficient. The Court emphasized that the statement of reasons must be clear and unequivocal, allowing the person concerned to ascertain the reasons for the measure and enabling the Court to review its legality.

The Court of Justice found that the statement of reasons provided by the Parliament was vague and did not disclose the reasoning followed by the institution in adopting the disciplinary measures against Daffix. The Court concluded that the statement of reasons did not meet the requirements of Article 253 EC and set aside the decision of the CFI.

This case is significant in the general scheme of EU law as it clarifies the requirements for a statement of reasons under Article 253 EC. It emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability in the decision-making process of EU institutions. The case also highlights the role of the Court of Justice in ensuring that EU institutions comply with their obligations under EU law.

In terms of procedural law, the case demonstrates the importance of providing a clear and coherent statement of reasons when adopting decisions that adversely affect individuals. It also illustrates the role of the Court of Justice in reviewing the legality of such decisions.

In terms of substantive law, the case underscores the importance of the principle of legality in the EU legal order. It emphasizes that EU institutions must act within the limits of their powers and provide clear and coherent reasons for their decisions.

Overall, the case of ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"" is an important precedent in EU law, as it clarifies the requirements for a statement of reasons under Article 253 EC and reinforces the principles of transparency, accountability, and legality in the decision-making process of EU institutions.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?"," a) In the context of EU law, an absolute right is one that cannot be limited or restricted under any circumstances, while a relative right is subject to limitations and can be balanced against other rights or public interests. An example of an absolute right from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 4). This right cannot be derogated from, even in times of emergency. On the other hand, the right to freedom of expression (Article 11) is a relative right, as it can be restricted in certain circumstances, such as to protect the reputation or rights of others, national security, or public health.

b) In the case of Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) acknowledged the importance of fundamental rights derived from the constitutional traditions of the Member States (MS) for several reasons. First, the Court recognized that the European Union (EU) legal order is not self-contained and must be open to external influences, including the constitutional traditions of the MS. Second, the Court acknowledged that the protection of fundamental rights is a shared responsibility between the EU and the MS, and that the EU legal order must be consistent with the fundamental rights recognized by the MS.

c) The three principal sources of EU fundamental rights are the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and the constitutional traditions common to the Member States. The Charter of Fundamental Rights is enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The ECHR is not directly mentioned in the treaties, but the EU is committed to acceding to the ECHR, as stated in Article 6(2) TEU. The constitutional traditions common to the MS are referred to in Article 6(3) TEU, which states that the EU shall respect the national identities of the MS, which are inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional, inclusive of regional and local self-government.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer."," A) The Italian authorities' decision to refuse Maria's residence renewal on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation does not appear to be in conformity with EU law. According to the principles established in ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Denmark"" (paragraph 64), a person who performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for remuneration is considered a worker, provided that the activities are real and genuine, and not merely marginal and ancillary. Maria's work as a science teacher, even if reduced to 15 hours a week, still constitutes a genuine activity, and she should be considered a worker under EU law.

B) Maria may have other options to reside in Italy beyond being considered an 'EU worker'. According to ""Georgios Orfanopoulos and Others (C-482/01) and Raffaele Oliveri (C-493/01) v Land Baden-Württemberg"" (paragraph 49), migrant workers who are nationals of a Member State have the right of residence if they remain a worker or, where relevant, a person seeking employment. Since Maria is still engaged in a genuine activity, she could potentially argue that she is a person seeking employment, and thus retain her right of residence in Italy. Additionally, she could explore other provisions of Community law that may grant her the right to reside in Italy, such as family reunification or self-employment.","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,

Rete Ferroviaria Italiana SpA, has not been provided. Please provide the necessary context or details from the case for me to assist you further.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start. Instead, keeping in mind that all languages are equally authentic, it is not sufficient for the national courts of last instance to only check one version, and they must be attentive when the parties bring forth differences between languages. [42-44]. - A different addition with Conzortio is the requirement for court of last resort to give reasons for not referring questions to the CJEU, reading Article 267 TFEU in light of art 47 of the Charter. [51] - Yet, the PRP is no redress for the parties [54] - The procedure is completely independent from initiative of the parties [53]",,,,,
Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts: a) Indirect challenge of an EU act b) National procedural autonomy c) The principle of supremacy d) Non-legislative EU act e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights,"a) Indirect challenge of an EU act: This term refers to a situation where an EU act is not directly challenged in court, but its validity is questioned in the context of a dispute between parties. In this situation, a national court may refer the question of the EU act's validity to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a preliminary ruling, in accordance with Article 267 TFEU. This process allows the CJEU to indirectly review and rule on the validity of the EU act in question.

b) National procedural autonomy: This principle refers to the ability of Member States to determine their own procedural rules when implementing EU law, as long as they do not conflict with the fundamental principles of EU law. This means that Member States have some flexibility in determining how to apply EU law within their own legal systems, as long as they respect the substantive requirements of EU law and uphold the fundamental rights protected by EU law.

c) The principle of supremacy: Also known as the doctrine of primacy, this principle holds that EU law has supremacy over national law in situations where the two conflict. This means that if a provision of national law is found to be incompatible with EU law, the national provision must be set aside or disapplied. This principle is essential for ensuring the uniform application and effectiveness of EU law throughout the Member States.

d) Non-legislative EU act: This term refers to any EU act that is not adopted through the ordinary legislative procedure (formerly known as the co-decision procedure). Non-legislative acts can take various forms, such as delegated acts, implementing acts, or decisions adopted by the European Commission, the Council, or the European Council. These acts are typically used to supplement or implement legislative acts adopted through the ordinary legislative procedure, and they must comply with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity.

e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights: The field of application of EU fundamental rights refers to the scope of situations and contexts in which the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and other general principles of EU law protecting fundamental rights apply. In general, these rights apply in situations where EU law has direct effect or where EU institutions, bodies, offices, or agencies are involved in the adoption of measures affecting fundamental rights. The CJEU has gradually expanded the field of application of EU fundamental rights, particularly in the context of the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice (AFSJ) and the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) framework.","a) Indirect challenge of an EU act - An EU act can be challenged outside of the review of legality procedure described in Article 263 TFEU. This follows from Article 277 TFEU. The idea of an indirect challenge is that the Court of Justice can review the validity of an EU act within the scope of a different procedure, for example the preliminary ruling procedure (see Article 267 TFEU).  b) National procedural autonomy - EU law normally (but naturally with many exceptions) contains material rules, but not rules about procedures and remedies. This is left for the Member States to regulate. This idea is known as national procedural autonomy. However, the Court of Justice has made it clear that national procedural rules must fulfil two conditions - equivalence and effectiveness. The former means that the national rules may not treat EU claims less favourable than comparable national claims. The latter means that it must not be excessively difficult or virtually impossible to obtain reparation. These conditions are articulated by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case (and in many others).  c) The principle of supremacy - In a situation of conflict between national law and EU law the latter should be given precedence. The principle was established by the Court of Justice in the Costa v ENEL case, and in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case the Court insisted on absolute supremacy, i.e. that any binding EU norm will take precedence over any national norm, even if the latter is part of the national constitution.  d) Non-legislative EU act - Following the Lisbon Treaty a distinction is made between legislative and non-legislative acts. This adds another dimension to the EU system of norms, supplementing the previous distinction between regulations, directives and decisions. From Article 289.3 TFEU it follows that legislative acts are adopted by a legislative procedure (the ordinary procedure or a special procedure). Consequently, a non-legislative act is an act that has not been created by any legislative procedure. However, it is important to emphasise that non-legislative acts are still binding. Examples of non-legislative acts include delegated acts (Article 290 TFEU) and implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU).  e) Field of application of EU fundamental rights - The field of application of EU fundamental rights, or differently put the scope of the rights, concerns what action and by whom is covered by the rights. According to Article 51 of the Charter the EU is bound by fundamental rights in all its action, but the Member States are only bound by them when they are 'implementing' EU law. This goes back to the limited power of the Union and the fact (emphasised in Article 6 TEU and Article 51.2 of the Charter) that the Charter does not expand the competences of the EU.",,,,,
"Assume the following: A dispute has arisen between two toy companies, the Swedish company Happy Times and the Danish company Big Fun. The Danish company is selling the controversial 'Bang', a toy gun that shoots water, in Sweden. Happy Times is upset, as their own sales have gone down due to the success of the 'Bang'. Happy Times argues that the sale of the 'Bang' is a violation of Swedish law. Swedish legislation clearly prohibits any 'immoral or inappropriate toys', and according to the Swedish preparatory works to the legislation this includes any toy imitating a firearm. Consequently, Swedish courts have upheld a ban on toys imitating firearms for more than 30 years.  A couple of years ago the EU issued the Safe Toys Directive. The directive is a maximum harmonization act, regulating all issues related to the production, marketing and sale of toys in the Member States. The background to the directive is that the significant differences in rules between the Member States have made trade in toys difficult between the states, thus hampering the proper function of the internal market. One of the goals of the directive is to limit the situations when a toy may be banned. Consequently, according to the directive the production, marketing or sale of a toy may only be prohibited when it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use'. However, Sweden has not implemented the directive, despite the fact that the implementation period has long since passed. Happy Times has now sued Big Fun before a local Swedish court, asking for a declaration that Big Fun is violating Swedish law by selling the 'Bang', and requesting compensation for lost profits due to the illegal sale of the toy. Big Fun is contesting the suit, and claims that it is protected by the Safe Toys Directive. Your assignment: Discuss thoroughly whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in any way in the situation above.","In the situation described, Big Fun, the Danish toy company, may argue that it can rely on the Safe Toys Directive in relation to the sale of the 'Bang' toy gun in Sweden. The Safe Toys Directive is a maximum harmonization act that aims to regulate all issues related to the production, marketing, and sale of toys within the Member States. One of the objectives of the directive is to limit situations where toys may be banned, allowing for the proper functioning of the internal market. According to the directive, the production, marketing, or sale of a toy may only be prohibited if it is 'obviously dangerous in normal use' (Boehringer Ingelheim KG, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG, Glaxo Group Ltd, The Wellcome Foundation Ltd, SmithKline Beecham plc, Beecham Group plc, SmithKline & French Laboratories Ltd and Eli Lilly and Co. v Swingward Ltd and Dowelhurst Ltd, 31).

However, Sweden has not implemented the Safe Toys Directive, even though the implementation period has passed. This failure to implement the directive may impact Big Fun's ability to rely on the directive's protections. In general, the principle of direct effect allows individuals to invoke provisions of a directive in their national courts when the Member State has failed to implement the directive (Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG v Centrafarm Vertriebsgesellschaft Pharmazeutischer Erzeugnisse mbH, 9). However, the directive in question is a maximum harmonization act, which may limit the application of the direct effect principle. Maximum harmonization acts typically aim to create a uniform regulatory environment across the EU, and national courts are generally prevented from applying stricter rules than those established by the directive (Proceedings for compulsory reconstruction against Smanor SA, 12).

In this context, it is uncertain whether Big Fun can rely on the Safe Toys Directive, as the directive has not been implemented in Sweden, and the situation involves a maximum harmonization act. It is recommended that the local Swedish court refer the question to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for a preliminary ruling to clarify the application of the Safe Toys Directive in this situation (The Queen, on the application of: Swedish Match AB and Swedish Match UK Ltd v Secretary of State for Health, 34). The CJEU would then provide guidance on whether the directive's provisions can be directly applied, considering the maximum harmonization nature of the directive and Sweden's failure to implement it. Furthermore, the CJEU could also address whether the 'Bang' toy gun can be considered 'obviously dangerous in normal use' under the Safe Toys Directive, and whether Swedish legislation prohibiting 'immoral or inappropriate toys' conflicts with the directive's objectives.","The first issue to be explored is whether Big Fun can directly use the Safe Toys Directive against Happy Times in the case before the Swedish court. We know, following the van Duyn case, that provisions in directives can have direct effect, assuming that they fulfil the general conditions (clear, precise and unconditional - see van Gend en Loos and following cases) and if the time period for implementation has passed (see e.g. the Ratti case). In the case at hand we know that the time period for implementation has passed and the provision stating that toys can only be banned if they are 'obviously dangerous in normal use' would appear to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional to be applied by national courts (compare the reasoning concerning what is now Article 45 TFEU in the van Duyn case). However, another issue is more problematic. According to e.g. the Dori case provisions in directives cannot be given horizontal direct effect. In the case at hand both parties are private companies, making this a horizontal relationship and excluding the use of the principle of direct effect. (An alternative, equally correct, answer would be to argue that this constitutes a triangular situation, as in the Unilever case. Big Fun simply requests the Swedish rules to be disapplied, so that they may sell their product. Following the Unilever line of cases this might be considered a triangular situation, not a horizontal one). If direct effect cannot be used the alternative is indirect effect, developed by the Court of Justice in the von Colson case. According to the principle of indirect effect national courts must interpret national law (implementation legislation as well as all other national legal provisions, see e.g. the Marleasing case) in line with the directive, to achieve the goals of the directive. Indirect effect is possible also in horizontal situations (see e.g. the Marleasing case). Full indirect effect requires that the time period for implementation has passed, which is the case in the situation at hand. However, indirect effect will only be successful if it is possible for the national court to interpret the national rules in line with the directive. In other words, some room for interpretation must exist (see e.g. the Dori case). Arguably, the Swedish legislation is worded in such general terms ('immoral or inappropriate') that it is possible for Swedish courts to give it a new interpretation in line with the directive. The fact that the Swedish preparatory works indicates another interpretation does not matter. National courts are not expected to interpret contra legem - against the wording of legislation - but they cannot rely on preparatory works to disregard their duties according to EU law. Thus, it should be possible for the Swedish court to interpret the Swedish legislation in line with the directive, allowing the sale of the 'Bang'. Issues of damages are not really part of the question, as it asks you to discuss how Big Fun can use EU law in the ongoing case against Happy Times. However, I have interpreted the question generously, giving points for well-crafted discussions of state liability as well. The principle of state liability was established by the Court of Justice in the Francovich case, giving individuals a right to damages if a Member State has violated a provision of EU law giving rights to individuals, the breach of EU law is sufficiently serious and if there is a causal link between the breach and the damage (see e.g. the Brasserie du Pêcheur case). In the situation at hand, assuming that Big Fun were not successful in their attempt to use direct or indirect effect to allow the sale of their product, they might be able to obtain damages instead. The Safe Toys Directive could be said to give them rights, as it is explicitly designed to allow the sale of toys. The breach of EU law by Sweden is sufficiently serious, as non implementation of a directive is always sufficiently serious (see e.g. Francovich). Finally, it could be argued that there is a clear causal link between the breach and their damage (loss of profit).",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) Special legislative procedure b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs), c) Concerted practices, d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings, e) Proportionality","a) Special legislative procedure: The special legislative procedure is a term used in EU law to describe the process where the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopt a legislative act, but the Parliament's role is limited to giving its consent or being consulted, while the Council has the main decision-making power. This procedure is provided for in the Treaties for specific policy areas where more detailed regulation is considered necessary, and it is to be distinguished from the ordinary legislative procedure (ex-codeceration procedure), where both the European Parliament and the Council have equal legislative powers. The special legislative procedure is referred to in Article 289(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

b) Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions (MEQRs): MEQRs are legislative, regulatory, or administrative measures adopted by EU Member States that hinder or discriminate against trade between Member States. They are prohibited by Article 34 TFEU (ex-Article 28 EC) and cover any measures that are capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade. This concept has been consistently interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union, as in Case 8/74 Dassonville [1974] ECR 837, to capture any national measure that might affect trade between Member States. However, MEQRs can be justified on grounds of public interest or imperative requirements, as long as they are appropriate and necessary to achieve the objective (Case C-270/02 Commission v Italy [2004] ECR I-1559, paragraph 21).

c) Concerted practices: Concerted practices are a concept developed under EU competition law, in particular Article 101 TFEU (ex-Article 81 EC). A concerted practice refers to a form of co-operation between two or more independent market operators, which, without having reached the stage where an agreement properly so called has been concluded, knowingly substitutes practical cooperation between them for the risks of competition (Case 48/69 ICI [1972] ECR 619, paragraph 63). Concerted practices can be restrictive of competition and may be prohibited unless they can be exempted under certain conditions (e.g., if they contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods or promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit and not imposing restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of these objectives or eliminating competition for a substantial part of the products in question—Article 101(3) TFEU).

d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are legal procedures initiated by the European Commission against EU Member States or other entities (e.g., companies) for breaching EU law. The infringement procedure is governed by Article 258 TFEU (ex-Article 226 EC) and aims to ensure that Member States comply with their obligations under EU law. The procedure starts with a formal letter of formal notice, followed by a reasoned opinion if the Member State does not comply. If the Member State still does not comply, the Commission may bring the case before the Court of Justice of the European Union. Infringement proceedings can also be initiated against companies for breaching EU competition law (Article 102 TFEU and/or Article 101 TFEU).

e) Proportionality: Proportionality is a general principle of EU law, which requires that any action taken by EU institutions or Member States must be suitable, necessary, and balanced in relation to the objective pursued. This principle is reflected in Article 5(4) TEU and has been developed by the Court of Justice of the European Union through its case law. The proportionality test includes three sub-principles: suitability (the measure must be capable of achieving the objective), necessity (there must be no less restrictive alternative), and proportionality stricto sensu (the benefits of the measure must not be disproportionate to its adverse effects).","a) Special legislative procedure: Legislative acts in the EU can be created by using either the ordinary or the special legislative procedure. Article 289.2 TFEU states that the special legislative procedure is used when specifically provided for in the Treaties. The somewhat enigmatic statement in Article 289.2 'by the European Parliament with the participation of the Council, or by the latter with the participation of the European Parliament' indicates that the special legislative procedure varies. In contrast to the ordinary legislative procedure, where the two institutions co-operate, one of the institutions typically dominate in the special legislative procedure. b) MEQR: MEQR are practical obstacles to trade. They are not quotas, but they have equivalent effect to quotas. MEQR are prohibited by Article 34 and 35 TFEU. The Court of Justice famously defined MEQR in Dassonville as any measure that 'directly or indirectly, actually or potentially' affect trade between the Member States. In later judgments the Court has differentiated between product rules (such as the ones in Cassis de Dijon) and selling arrangements (such as the ones in Keck), but also done a complete re-take on MEQR in the Trailers case, concluding that discriminatory rules, product rules and any other measure that prevent market access are MEQR. c) Concerted practices: 'Concerted practices' is a term used in EU competition law, more specifically in Article 101 TFEU. Article 101 prohibits cartels, often formed by agreements between undertakings. The idea of concerted practices is a safety net, catching forms of collusion not created by a formal agreement, but by undertakings knowingly substituting practical co-operation. This is usually demonstrated by the behaviour of the companies in question. d) Enforcement actions/infringement proceedings: Enforcement actions or infringement proceedings are two names for the legal procedure that can be initiated against a Member State in violation of EU law, by action or inaction. The procedure is primarily regulated by Article 258 TFEU, laying down first an administrative and then a legal procedure. The Commission normally plays the leading role in enforcement actions, but it is possible for another Member State to initiate enforcement action according to Article 259 TFEU. According to Article 260 the CJEU can impose a lump sum or penalty payment as part of the procedure. e) Proportionality: According to the principle of proportionality a measure must be both suitable and necessary to achieve the stated objective. It applies to both the EU and the Member States. Article 5.4 TEU makes it clear that Union action must always (thus, even in areas of exclusive EU competence) respect the principle of proportionality. The principle is also famously applied when the Member States limit the freedom of movement on the internal market. In these situations the CJEU has sometimes applied the proportionality principle strictly, putting extensive demands on the Member States. The Commission v Portugal case, concerning sun film on cars, is an example of this strict scrutiny.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario: Cynthia, a French national who is living in Belgium with her Belgian boyfriend, wants to renew her residence permit. When she arrived in Belgium she had a full-time job as a chemistry lecturer at the University of Brussels, but now she is only working 10 hours a week as a private chemistry teacher. According to the Belgian authorities, this modification in her employment situation means that she can no longer be considered an “EU worker”. a) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? She later seeks a job at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media, but her application is rejected on the grounds that she is not a Belgian citizen. According to Belgian law, only Belgian citizens can hold these jobs. b) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? Cynthia also seeks a job at a private academy as a tutor for university students who need extra support in chemistry. Once again, her application is rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen and because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the employment. According to the recruiters, even if French is the official language, an advanced level of other EU languages is necessary for the job as many of their students are exchange students who need classes in their native languages. c) Is this in accordance with EU law? Why/why not? When you answer the questions above try to organize a concise answer, explaining your reasoning and stating the relevant sources of EU law.","a) According to the case ""Mouvement contre le racisme, l'antisémitisme et la xénophobie ASBL (MRAX) v Belgian State,"" the expiration of a visa does not prevent the issuance of a residence permit to a third-country national who is married to a national of a Member State and entered the territory of that Member State lawfully. However, the case does not specifically address the issue of a modification in the employment situation of the EU worker. In the case ""Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Belgium,"" the court found that limiting the financing of vocational higher education establishments that results in the exclusion of students from other Member States constitutes discrimination on grounds of nationality. Nonetheless, the court did not rule on whether a reduction in working hours would affect the status of an EU worker. Therefore, it is unclear whether this modification in Cynthia's employment situation would impact her status as an EU worker under Belgian law.

b) In the case ""Georgios Alevizos v Ypourgos Oikonomikon,"" the court held that Member States have the opportunity to restrict admission of foreign nationals to certain positions in the public service that presume a special relationship of allegiance to the State. The court also stated that once admitted into the public service of a Member State, a worker cannot be disentitled to the application of the provisions contained in the relevant EC treaty articles. However, in this scenario, Cynthia's application was rejected because she is not a Belgian citizen, and Belgian law restricts certain jobs to Belgian citizens. Therefore, it seems that this is in accordance with EU law.

c) In the case ""Raymond Vander Elst v Office des Migrations Internationales,"" the court held that the application of national rules of public policy governing the various aspects of the employment relationship to workers sent temporarily to France does not necessarily exclude any substantial risk of workers being exploited or of competition between undertakings being distorted. However, in this scenario, Cynthia's application was rejected not only because she is not a Belgian citizen but also because she does not comply with the linguistic requirements for the job. The case does not address whether linguistic requirements can be considered a legitimate ground for restricting employment to Belgian citizens only. Therefore, it is unclear whether this is in accordance with EU law.","a) The personal scope of Article 45 TFEU: According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Cynthia is a French national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Cynthia is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Belgian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Belgian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. b) The public service exception: Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. To refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). It would be necessary therefore to examine if the job that Cynthia has applied for at the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Policy and Media falls within this category. c) Nationality requirements: As introduced above, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). Under the light of the above, to refuse Cynthia a job because of her nationality constitutes direct discrimination. A private academy is not under the exception included in Article 45 (4) TFEU concerning jobs in the public service. Language requirements: As we discussed in class, ECJ recognized prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination. It follows from the case law of the Court that: '[t]he rules regarding equality of treatment, both in the Treaty and in Article 7, forbid not only overt discrimination by reason of nationality but also all covert forms of discrimination which, by the application of other criteria of differentiation, lead in fact to the same result' (Sotgiu v. Deutsche Bundespost). Accordingly, indirect discrimination occurs when national laws do not include discrimination on the surface (i.e. they are applicable irrespective of nationality) but create in practice a discriminatory effect towards migrant workers or they are more easily satisfied by national workers than by migrant workers. Language requirements are likely to have an indirect discriminatory effect, since the host country's own citizens are more likely to meet the requirements. However, in this hypothetical scenario, the requirement of a third language does not favor Belgian citizens and it is related to the nature of the job, which can lead one to conclude that the linguistic knowledge required has not been applied in a discriminatory manner.",,,,,
"Problem is brewing in Fantasia, a member state of the European Union. Good Enough is a private company offering various construction services, primarily to other companies. Good Enough has recently acquired a contract to build a new company headquarters for Big Money, a private bank in Fantasia. However, after completing the construction Good Enough and Big Money became embroiled in a dispute. The bank argued that Good Enough had not fulfilled the contract between the parties. The contract stipulated that the building should be constructed “in accordance with national legislation in force on January 1, 2019”. More specifically, Big Money pointed to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Paragraph 138 of said national legislation requires that any building designed for more than 10 people (living or working) must include a shelter. Said shelter must be large enough to accommodate all persons living or working in the building. Furthermore, the shelter must be constructed to certain specifications, including being constructed by reinforced concrete. Good Enough has not included a shelter in the building, as they think it is totally unnecessary. Reinforced concrete is also very expensive, and its use would make the project economically unrealistic. Furthermore, Good Enough points to the Safe Building Directive, adopted by the European Union in 2015. Article 1 of the directive establishes that the aim of the directive is to harmonize building standards in the Member States, to enable trade in construction work on the internal market. Articles 5-15 of the directive establish (in considerable detail) the meaning of good building practices for different kinds of buildings. Article 20 of the directive states: “The Member States may not introduce any further requirements on construction work and good building practices, beyond what is laid down in Article 5-15”. Article 5-15 does not mention shelters as part of any building type. The Safe Building Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament in May 2015. It entered into force on the first of June 2015. Article 30 of the Directive states: “The Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 31 December 2016”. Fantasia implemented the Directive on June 1, 2016, by adopting the 2016 Construction Act. The act reproduces, word for word, Article 5-15 of the Safe Building Directive. However, no changes were made to the 1948 Law on Public Safety. Big Money has now sued Good Enough before a local court in Fantasia, demanding damages as Good Enough is in breach of contract due to the missing shelter. Good Enough disputes the claim, arguing that paragraph 138 of the 1948 Law on Public Safety must be set aside in the case at hand. Good Enough claims that the fact that paragraph 138 was not repealed is obviously just a mistake and that they can rely on Article 20 of the Safe Building Directive in the dispute. Big Money has responded to this claim by stating that the 1948 Law on Public Safety was in effect on January 1, 2019, and still remains in effect. Furthermore, they claim that the 1948 Law was not affected by the Safe Building Directive, as it concerns the separate issue of public safety. Your assignment: You are a judge at the above-mentioned local court in Fantasia, in charge of the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough. Discuss thoroughly how you would resolve the EU law-related issues in the case, and why?","As a judge in the local court of Fantasia, I would resolve the EU law-related issues in the dispute between Big Money and Good Enough by analyzing the relevant case law and the Safe Building Directive. The central questions are whether Good Enough can rely on the Safe Building Directive to set aside the requirement of a shelter in the 1948 Law on Public Safety, and whether the 194","The question concerns direct effect - Good Enough (GE) expressly states that it wants to “rely on Article 20” before the local court. However, first we must decide if there is a conflict between national law and EU law. Big Money (BM) claims that no conflict exists - which would put an end to the discussion. However, it is clear that the issue is regulated by EU law. Article 1 of the Directive states that its aim is harmonize building standards and enable trade. Consequently, the 1948 Law on Public Safety is in conflict with the Directive. Before moving on it is important to note that supremacy needs direct effect to work. If the EU provision cannot be relied upon there is no conflict. Direct effect is possible if the provision is clear, precise and unconditional (e.g. van Duyn). That is the case here - Article 20 is clear on not allowing demands other than those in Art. 5-15. However, this is a dispute between two private parties, and directives cannot produce horizontal direct effect (e.g. Dori). An alternative is indirect effect, i.e. the duty of the local court to interpret national law in light of the Directive (e.g. von Colson). It applies also in horizontal situations (Marleasing). The duty of indirect effect requires extensive effort on behalf of the national court, but it is not without limits. There is no duty to interpret contra legem, against the clear wording. For indirect effect to work the national court needs some room to interpret. This appears difficult in the case at hand. The 1948 Law is very specific, and it seems unlikely that the local court can interpret this obligation away. (An alternative to discussing indirect effect is to discuss so-called triangular situations - e.g. CIA Security. It is possible to argue that it could be applied here, and that it is not a horizontal situation but rather so-called incidental effects. However, the consequences would be to alter the terms of private contract, which is problematic.) The final option is state liability (Francovich). The provision in question must create rights for individuals, the breach must be sufficiently serious and there must be a causal link between breach and damage (Brasserie du Pêcheur). The first condition is arguably fulfilled. Article 20 could be regarded as a right for traders not to be subject to further rules. Regarding the second condition: This is a case of incorrect implementation, why sufficient breach must be established. This should be possible, as Fantasia should have been aware of the 1948 law. Finally, whether the causal link is fulfilled or not is open to discussion. GE could have avoided the situation by negotiating a different. The main hurdle when it comes to state liability is that the Member State is not part of the process before the court. GE would have to start a separate case against Fantasia, if they lose the case against BM.",,,,,
"Please briefly define and explain each of the following EU law terms and concepts. Remember to cite relevant legal authority (Treaty articles and cases, if relevant) in support of each answer: a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) b) State liability c) The roeliminary ruling procedure d) indirect effect e) Subsidiarity","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP) is a legislative process defined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which replaced the codecision procedure under the former Treaty of Amsterdam. The OLP applies to a wide range of policy areas and gives the European Parliament and the Council of the Ministers equal footing in the legislative process. It consists of two readings and, if necessary, a conciliation stage to resolve any differences between the institutions (Article 294 TFEU). The OLP is the standard legislative procedure in the EU, reflecting the increased role of the European Parliament in the decision-making process.

b) State liability is a legal principle established by the European Court of Justice in the cases Brasserie du Pêcheur SA v Bundesrepublik Deutschland and The Queen v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte: Factortame Ltd and others. According to this principle, a Member State can be held liable for damages resulting from a breach of EU law if three conditions are met: the rule of law infringed is intended to confer rights on individuals, the breach is sufficiently serious, and there is a direct causal link between the breach and the damage suffered by the individuals (see paragraph 43 of Brasserie du Pêcheur). This principle reinforces the effectiveness and primacy of EU law by ensuring that Member States are responsible for any adverse consequences resulting from their failure to comply with EU obligations.

c) The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism established by Article 267 TFEU, allowing national courts to refer questions of EU law to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a binding interpretation. This procedure is crucial for ensuring the uniform application and consistency of EU law throughout the Member States. When a national court faces a question concerning the interpretation or validity of EU law, it may refer the question to the ECJ, which will then provide an authoritative answer. The national court is bound by the ECJ's interpretation and must apply it in the case at hand.

d) Indirect effect is a legal concept derived from the ECJ's case law, which requires national courts to interpret and apply national law in light of EU law, even if there is no explicit conflict between the two. This principle was first articulated in the case of Von Colson and Kamann v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen and has since been affirmed in numerous subsequent judgments. The indirect effect doctrine promotes the uniform application of EU law and prevents national law from undermining the effectiveness of EU provisions.

e) Subsidiarity is a principle enshrined in the TFEU (Article 5(3)), which governs the allocation of competences between the EU and its Member States. According to the subsidiarity principle, the EU shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central level or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level. This principle reflects the EU's commitment to respecting the sovereignty and autonomy of its Member States, while ensuring that collective action is taken when necessary for the effective functioning of the Union.","a) The ordinary legislative procedure (OLP): Article 294 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union sets out the content of the ordinary legislative procedure. The Commission holds the initiative and sends the legislative proposal to the Parliament and the Council. The latter two share equal power. There are three potential 'readings' in the process. The Parliament votes with simple/absolute majority and the Council with qualified majority/unanimously. In practice, the procedure includes informal negotiations called trilogues speeding up the legislative process. b) State liability: The principle of state liability entails that a Member State is liable for loss and damages caused to individuals as a result of breaches of EU law. The legal basis is found in the case-law of the Court of Justice, namely Francovich. The principle was later adjusted in Brasserie du pêcheur. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled. 1. the rule of Union law breached is intended to create rights for the individual, 2. the breach is sufficiently serious, and, 3. there is a casual link between the breach of the obligation borne by the state and the damage suffered. c) Preliminary ruling procedure: The preliminary ruling procedure is a mechanism where national judges can turn to the Court of Justice and ask how unclear EU law provisions are to be interpreted, but also about the validity of EU provisions. This is stated in Article 267 Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Apex courts are as a rule of thumb under an obligation to refer (exceptions in CILFIT and Consorzio Italian Management) while lower courts may submit questions. Questions regarding validity must however be referred, see Foto-Frost. The preliminary ruling procedure aims at securing a uniform interpretation/application of EU law in the Union, but also to secure individual's EU rights. d) Indirect effect: If the conditions for direct effect for a directive is not met, the next best thing is indirect effect. The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. e) Subsidiarity: Article 5(3) Treaty on European Union states that “[…] in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence”, “The Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives and proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level”. The principle separates the presence of the Union's competence and the possibility of exercising that competence. National parliaments play a controlling role. The subsidiarity Protocol is important in that regard.",,,,,
"Imagine the following scenarios: A. Anna, a Swedish citizen, has moved to Italy where she wants to attend a private boarding school. When she applies for a job in an Italian company, her school diploma is denied employment on the grounds that she is not an Italian citizen. i) Is the Italian public school's decision in conformity with EU law? (Think about non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, interference with right, justification and explain your reasoning, supporting each step with citations to EU legal sources.) ii) What remedies might be available to her? (Think, can she bring court proceedings against the decision, if she wishes to do so and if so where, under what legal authority?) B. Juan is Spanish and lives in Madrid with his Argentine wife Carmen. The couple are now planning to move to Portugal but according to Portuguese authorities Carmen could not be granted a residence permit because she is not a Union citizen. i) Is the Portuguese authority's decision in conformity with EU law and why or why not? (Reason as with A(i) above), yet use question B facts.) ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one what can be done at EU level to remedy the situation? (Include whether it can bring a court proceeding against Portugal.) Your assignment: Answer each sub-question from a EU law perspective. Support your answers by referring at every opportunity during your answers when relevant references are made of sources of EU law. Make clear which sub-question you are answering. Where appropriate provide specific examples (like in math class), not simply an unexplained answer. In other words describe several steps applying the law you have learned to these facts and demonstrating your understanding of how they fit within the broader context of the EU legal system functions.","A(i) The Italian public school's decision to deny employment to Anna based on her non-Italian citizenship may not be in conformity with EU law. According to the case-law, any discrimination on the grounds of nationality is generally prohibited within the EU (Ciola, paragraph 14). This principle extends to accessing employment opportunities, as stated in the context of Case C-355/98 Commission v Belgium. It is immaterial whether the contested measure affects, in some circumstances, nationals of the State in question resident in other parts of the national territory (Ciola, paragraph 14). Therefore, it seems that the Italian school's decision may be considered discriminatory and not in line with the EU non-discrimination principle.

A(ii) If Anna wishes to challenge this decision, she may bring court proceedings against the decision in Italy, as the situation prevailing in the Member State at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion is the relevant one for assessing a potential breach of EU law (Commission v Portugal (C-435/99), paragraph 16). The Court cannot take account of any subsequent changes. The relevant legal authority in this case would be the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), specifically Article 18 on non-discrimination on grounds of nationality.

B(i) The Portuguese authority's decision to deny a residence permit to Carmen, the Argentine wife of a Spanish citizen (Juan), may not be in conformity with EU law. As per the case-law, the right of entry into the territory of a Member State granted to a third-country national who is the spouse of a national of a Member State derives from the family relationship alone, and the issue of a residence permit is to be regarded as a measure serving to prove the individual position of a national of a third country with regard to provisions of Community law (MRAX, paragraph 74).

B(ii) If Portugal routinely fails to grant residence permits like this one, the situation could be remedied at the EU level through infringement proceedings brought by the European Commission against Portugal for the potential breach of EU law. The Commission could rely on Article 258 TFEU, which grants it the power to bring such actions against Member States. The relevant legal background is provided in Case C-435/99 Commission v Portugal, where the Court determined that the question of whether a Member State has failed to fulfill its obligations must be determined by reference to the situation prevailing in the Member State at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion, and the Court cannot take account of any subsequent changes.","A. Anna from Sweden Applying to be Employed as a Public School Teacher in Italy i) An EU Right?: Does Anna have a right protected by EU law here? Since Sweden is part of the Union and Anna holds Swedish citizenship she automatically holds EU citizenship as well and thus has free movement rights on that basis (Articles 20-21 TFEU). Separately, according to Article 45(2) TFEU, discrimination based on the nationality of a “worker” from one Member State working in or applying to work in another Member State is prohibited unless justified as provided in Article 45(3). She therefore does have a protected right here. An Interference with that Right?: In this case, Anna is being rejected as a job applicant by officials of the Italian state because of her nationality from another EU Member State, which is clearly an interference and possible unlawful infringement of her right to free movement as a worker under EU law. Public schools and other public employers are state actors and have a “duty of loyalty” to further EU objectives and not to violate EU law, per for example Article 4(3) TEU, the same article cited by the CJEU in holding national courts responsible for interpreting national law in harmony with Union law to the extent possible. Any Justification?: The Italian state can attempt to rely on Article 45(4) TFEU to argue that since the position Anna is applying for is within the public sector, she does not have the right to rely on Article 45(2). The Court of Justice of the European Union (the CJEU) has, however, made clear in case law that this “public service exception” must be applied narrowly, only to certain positions involving official duties as a representative of the state also involving for example access to particularly sensitive information from a state security perspective. The Court has decided in particular that a position as a public school teacher does not fit that narrow exception. Therefore Italy will not succeed in using that justification for discriminating in this case. ii) Anna could bring the case against the public school to which she applied in the appropriate Italian national court, since she lives in Italy. Member States have “procedural autonomy”, in other words the EU does not have competence to harmonize their procedural law including specific nationally-available remedies in court actions, and therefore which court is appropriate for this case about job applicant discrimination in violation of EU law, and other rules like how to file the action, will be controlled by national law. There will be “direct effect” for Art. 45 TFEU as CJEU case law has previously established it to be sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional. According to EU law concerning remedies, see Art. 19 TFEU, there will need to be a remedy available in the Italian courts (or other government agencies) that is “effective” (serious enough to protect her EU right) and at least “equivalent” to the level of remedy provided in Italy for violations of national law, otherwise the Italian state will be in violation of EU law on that topic. See as a legal source for this, for example, the CJEU case law for seminars 6 or 7 [Case 199/82, Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v SpA San Giorgio, 9 November 1983 but you did not need to remember that] clarifying Article 19(1) TEU on the judicial system of the EU and on national procedural autonomy, and of course the article itself. (Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights also guarantees Anna's right to an effective remedy.) B. Juan from Spain Applying for (non-EU-citizen) Family Member Residence Permits in Portugal i) Right?: Juan has the same rights to move freely as Anna, above, probably as a worker but at least as a citizen of his home Member State and therefore a Union citizen. To exercise these rights, he is allowed to bring his immediate family members with him across the internal national borders within the EU's free market, including his spouse, per the EU secondary law we read about for the Free Movement of Persons seminar [the Citizenship Directive, Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States]. Thu there is a right here, for him and by extension for her. Interference?: The authorities in Portugal, we are told, have denied Carmen a residence permit, interfering with the EU citizen's family's ability to move freely within the EU, which is an interference. Justification?: Under the Treaties, Member States can attempt to justify their actions interfering with EU-law-based free movement of persons rights by claiming that they do so on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The justification has to be made based on personal conduct of the individual denied entry or a residence permit however, and otherwise be held to be proportional. The legal sources for this include the CJEU case of the EU citizen (Dutch) woman applying to enter and move to the (then-Member-State) UK to work for the Church of Scientology, considered a cult but not made illegal by the Member State denying her a residence permit. Public policy justification by the Member State was allowed in that case [Van Duyn v Home Office (1974) C-41/74], so long as the national court found that the rejection of her entry was based on her personal conduct, not a blanket discrimination. In this case, we do not know any reason for Portugal denying Carmen a residence permit, other than her lack of EU nationality, so that is very likely an unjustifiable direct violation of EU law by Portugal. ii) If Portugal did this routinely, an EU institution, specifically the European Commission (the “watchdog of the Union”) could seek a Union-level remedy. It has “standing” to do so: the Commission is authorized to bring a “direct action” against the Member State in the CJEU, pursuant to Article 258 TFEU, second indent, after first following the procedure, set forth in that same article, first indent, of communicating in writing (delivering a “reasoned opinion”) to the Member State, giving it the “opportunity to submit its observations” and then waiting for a period of time (announced by the Commission) first to try to get its agreement to stop its actions in violation of EU law without having to litigate the case in the Court. In the end, remedies awarded (see Art. 260 TFEU) might include fines as well as an order that the Portugal is confirmed to be in violation of EU law, and pressure will continue to be applied to it by the EU institutions, legally and politically, until it changes its practices.",,,,,
"In 2016 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed a new directive concerning reduction of national emissions, Directive (EU) 2016/2284 on the reduction of national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants. The Directive sets national reduction commitments for five main air pollutants that have a significant negative impact on human health and the environment. These are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2,5). According to the directive, the Member States are required to, among other things, monitor and report the emissions of these five pollutants (articles 9 and 10.4). Article 9: Member States shall ensure the monitoring of negative impacts of air pollution upon ecosystems based on a network of monitoring sites that is representative of their freshwater, natural and semi natural habitats and forest ecosystem types, taking a cost-effective and risk-based approach. Article 10.4: Member States shall report the following information referred to in Article 9 to the Commission and the European Environment Agency a) by 1 July 2018 and every four years thereafter, the location of the monitoring sites and the associated indicators used for monitoring air pollution impacts; and b) by 1 July 2019 and every four years thereafter, the monitoring data referred to in Article 9. The latest report from the monitoring was meant to be reported by the first of July 2022. Italy has still not sent their latest report to the Commission and the European Environment Agency. Answer the following questions. Don't forget to refer to the relevant articles in the Treaties. 1) Which article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations? 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement?","1) According to Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), Member States have a duty to take any appropriate measure, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising from the Treaties or resulting from action taken by the institutions of the Union. This includes the obligation to implement and enforce EU directives, such as the requirement to monitor and report emissions under Directive (EU) 2","1) What article in one of the Treaties states that the Member States have a duty to fulfil their EU obligations: According to article 4(3) in the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) the Member States shall take any appropriate measure, general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union. 2) Can the European Union take any formal action towards Italy, if the European Union suspects that the country is breaching the Union law? Describe the formal action: In this question, I wanted you to describe the Infringement procedure (and also name it). The procedure is described in article 258 in TFEU. So, if the Commission considers that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties the Commission can send a reasoned opinion on the matter, after giving Italy the opportunity to reply. In this case Italy has not submitted the monitoring reports to the Commission within the time frame – this can be considered a breach of Union law (please note that failing to send monitoring reports to the Commission is not the same as failing to notify measures transposing a directive). If Italy does not comply with the opinion within a certain period decided by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3) If this case would get referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Court would find that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties; what happens if Italy won't comply with the judgement: The answer to this question is found in article 260 (1 and 2) TFEU: According to article 260 (1) in TFEU, if the Court of Justice of the European Union finds that Italy has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties, Italy must take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Article 260 (2) states that if the Commission considers that Italy has not taken the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court (for example Italy has not sent in the monitoring reports to the Commission), the Commission can choose to bring the case before the Court once more. Before the case is referred before the Court, Italy must be given an opportunity to reply to why the country hasn't complied with the judgement. The Commission specifies an appropriate amount of the lump sum or penalty payment to be paid by Italy, but it is the Court that decides the sum.",,,,,
"1. Present the decision of the case. This presentation should include, in your own words (only highlighting text in the judgment won't give points), a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate.","1. In the case of ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix,"" the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) considered whether a proper statement of reasons was provided by the contested decision. The Commission brought an action against Mr. Daffix for failing to fulfill his obligations under EU law. The dispute arose due to Mr. Daffix's failure to comply with a Commission decision, which required him to submit certain information as part of an investigation into possible anti-competitive practices [12].

The case went through several stages of litigation, culminating in the CJEU. The central legal issue discussed by the Court was whether the statement of reasons provided in the contested decision met the requirements of EU law, as outlined in Article 253 EC. The CJEU noted that the statement of reasons must be appropriate to the act at issue, clear, and unequivocal, disclosing the reasoning followed by the institution adopting the measure [43]. The Court also considered whether the contested decision fulfilled the requirements of Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure, which mandates that an application must state the subject-matter of the proceedings and a summary of the pleas in law on which the application is based [12, 30, 22, 27, 103].

In its analysis, the CJEU referred to previous cases, including ""Commission v Greece,"" ""Commission v Ireland,"" ""Commission v Finland,"" ""Commission v Spain,"" ""Commission v Italy,"" ""Commission v France,"" ""Commission v Département du Loiret and Scott SA,"" and ""Z v European Parliament."" The Court concluded that the contested decision did not provide sufficient reasons for the measures taken against Mr. Daffix, and thus, the decision was annulled [12, 43].

2. The case ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"" highlights the importance of providing a clear and unequivocal statement of reasons in decisions made under EU law. This requirement ensures that the parties involved can understand the reasons for the decision and allows the CJEU to exercise its power of review effectively. The case also emphasizes the importance of adhering to the procedures outlined in the Rules of Procedure, specifically Article 38(1)(c), which requires a clear and precise statement of the subject-matter of the proceedings and the pleas in law on which the application is based [12, 30, 22, 27, 103]. This case aligns with the broader principles of EU law, which seek to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in the decision-making process [12, 43].

Moreover, this case study demonstrates the CJEU's consistent approach in interpreting and applying the EU legal framework, specifically in the context of the statement of reasons and the requirements under Article 38(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure. This adherence to established legal principles contributes to the uniformity and predictability of EU law, fostering legal certainty for all parties involved in cross-border disputes. The case also underscores the role of the CJEU as the ultimate arbiter of EU law, responsible for ensuring that the institutions of the Union act in compliance with the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

In conclusion, ""Commission of the European Communities v Frédéric Daffix"" serves as an essential reminder of the importance of clear and unequivocal statements of reasons in EU decisions and the need for adherence to procedural rules. The case highlights the CJEU's commitment to transparency, fairness, and legal certainty in the interpretation and application of EU law, further strengthening the rule of law in the European Union.","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about: The company Marleasing took the other companies to court claiming that the respondent company's articles of association were created only to defraud creditors. The applicant claimed that the articles should be declared void. Spanish law included as ground for a company's nullity the lack of cause, but EU law did not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why: The case arrived at the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure laid out in Article 267 TFEU. A Spanish judge in a lower court had asked the CJEU whether Article 11 of the Company law Directive 68/151 precludes declaring a company void on grounds not listed in the directive. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice: The issue concerned whether the Spanish court was under an obligation to interpret the national law in light of the directive and thus preclude a declaration of nullity. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law: Horizontal claim regarding Company law Directive 68/151. Marshall Von Colson e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed: At the national level: Marleasing claimed that the company should be nullified referencing national law, while the respondent shielded themselves with EU law, claiming that the directive does not list lack of cause as ground for annulment. CJEU: - No horizontal effect of directives (Marshall) - The Court then highlighted Von Colson and the doctrine of indirect effect. It added that the obligation of the national court to interpret national law in light of the wording and purpose of the directive exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive, and that the duty implies interpreting “as far as possible” to achieve the result of the directive. - The preamble of the Directive, and interests of third parties gives clear guidance for interpreting the list of grounds in Article 11 of the Directive strictly. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s): Thus, interpreting national law in light of the Company Law Directive precludes the option, under national law, to nullify a company on grounds other than those listed in the directive. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case's areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits. 2) When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. Indirect effect: When direct effect fails meaning that an individual cannot rely directly on an EU directive, indirect effect may save the day. In this case, there was a horizontal situation, two private parties, and therefore the directive cannot have direct effect (Marshall, Farell etc.) The principle of indirect effect lays out an obligation for national courts to interpret domestic law, as far as possible, in conformity with directives. The principle was developed in Von Colson. The obligation applies even where the national law predates the directive, it requires national courts to make changes to established case law, if it is based on an interpretation of domestic law contravening the objectives of a directive, but it does not oblige interpretations of domestic law contra legem. The two take-aways from Marleasing are: - that the duty exists regardless of whether the national law was adopted before or after the directive - and that it is limited by interpreting 'as far as possible'. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure (optional): The preliminary ruling procedure (Article 267 TFEU) enables lower national courts and obliges national courts whose decision there is no judicial remedy, to ask the European Court of Justice (CJEU) how to interpret and apply unclear EU law. The duty for apex courts is relaxed by the fact that national courts only need to refer when it is necessary for the outcome of the case, and by the CILFIT criteria (CJEU previously ruled on a materially identical question, or the correct interpretation is obvious with some qualifications). When it comes to the validity of EU law, all national courts, irrespective of where they are in the hierarchy have a duty to refer (Foto-Frost). Primacy (optional): Primacy or supremacy of EU law signifies that in a conflict between EU law and national law, the national provision must be set aside in the favour of EU law (Costa v. E.N.E.L). This is the case for both primary and secondary EU law, even in conflict with Member States national constitutions (Internationale Handelsgesellschaft).",,,,,
"a) Please describe the difference between an absolute and relative right and provide an example of each from the EU charter of fundamental rights. b) In case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU declared that “respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court of justice. The protection of such rights, whilst inspired by the constitutional traditions common to the MS, must be ensured within the framework of the Community.” Give at least two reasons why the court went in this direction when it had previously been hesitant to acknowledge fundamental rights stemming from the MS constitutional laws? c) Name the three principal sources (“bill of rights”) of EU fundamental rights and where in the treaties these three are stated?","a) In the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, rights can be either absolute or relative. Absolute rights are those which admit of no limitation and must be respected without exception. For example, the right to human dignity (Article 1) is an absolute right, as it is fundamental and inalienable. Relative rights, on the other hand, can be limited or restricted in certain circumstances. An example of a relative right is the right to property (Article 17). While this right is protected, it can be subject to limitations if they are necessary and proportionate, such as in the public interest or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

b) In Case 11/70 Internationale Handelsgesellschaft, the CJEU recognized that respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law protected by the court. There were two main reasons for this shift in position. First, the CJEU recognized the need to ensure the uniformity and consistency of Community law, and to prevent inconsistencies or contradictions between national laws and Community law. Second, the CJEU acknowledged that the European Community was based on the rule of law, and that fundamental rights were an essential component of this legal order. By recognizing fundamental rights as general principles of law, the CJEU sought to ensure that these rights were protected and upheld within the Community.

c) The three principal sources of EU fundamental rights are:

1. The constitutional traditions common to the Member States: This source draws on the shared values and principles that underpin the legal systems of the Member States, and provides a common basis for the protection of fundamental rights within the EU. This source is mentioned in Article 6(3) TEU.
2. The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR): The EU is a signatory to the ECHR, and the Convention provides a further source of fundamental rights for the EU. This source is mentioned in Article 6(2) TEU.
3. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union: The Charter is a comprehensive codification of the fundamental rights protected within the EU, and provides a clear and accessible statement of these rights. The Charter is mentioned in Article 6(1) TEU.","a) An absolute right is a right that cannot ever be justified to infringe on, such as the right to life stated in article 2 in the EU charter of fundamental rights. An example of a relative right is the right to freedom stated in article 6, as this right can under certain circumstances be allowed to be infringed upon. b) One possible reason the court went in this direction is that the community (EU) was under pressure from certain member states to protect human rights. Another reason is that it made it possible for the court to still be considered supreme over national laws while still being able to draw inspiration from national laws when it found it necessary to do so. c) The three bill of rights are stated in article 6 FEU: the EU charter of fundamental rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human rights and constitutional traditions common to the member states.",,,,,
"Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. Try to organise a concise answer explaining your reasoning and stating the sources of EU law in question (primary and secondary EU law, including case law) concerning free movement of persons. Maria, a Portuguese woman who is living in Italy wants to renew her residence. However, she is refused on the grounds that she is not engaged in a gainful occupation. When she arrived in Italy she had a full-time work at a primary school as a science teacher, but now she is only working 15 hours a week. According to the Italian authorities, this means she cannot be considered a privileged 'EU worker'. A) Is this decision in conformity with EU law? And why or why not? B) Does she have any other option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy? Briefly explain and motivate your answer.","A) The decision made by the Italian authorities may not be in conformity with EU law. According to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), freedom of movement for workers within the European Community entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment (Case C‑281/98 Angonese [2000] ECR I‑4139, paragraph 29). Even if the rules on freedom of movement for workers are directed at ensuring that foreign nationals are treated in the host Member State in the same way as nationals, they also preclude the State of origin from obstructing the freedom of one of its nationals to accept and pursue employment in another Member State (Case C-385/00 De Groot [2002] ECR I-11819, paragraph 79). Therefore, Maria, as a Portuguese worker in Italy, should not be discriminated against based on her working hours. However, the CJEU has not specified a minimum number of working hours required to be considered a 'worker' for the purposes of free movement. In Case 66/85 Lawrie-Blum [1986] ECR 2121, paragraphs 16 and 17, the CJEU held that any person who pursues activities which are real and genuine, to the exclusion of activities on such a small scale as to be regarded as purely marginal and ancillary, is entitled to freedom of movement as a worker. It would be up to the Italian courts to assess whether Maria's 15-hour-per-week job meets this threshold.

B) Yes, Maria may have another option beyond being a 'EU worker' to still reside in Italy. According to Case C-292/89 Antonissen [1991] ECR I-745, paragraph 22, the right of residence of migrant workers who are nationals of a Member State is subject to the condition that the person remains a worker or, where relevant, a person seeking employment. However, Maria could also derive her right of residence from other provisions of EU law. For instance, Directive 2004/38/EC (the 'Citizens' Rights Directive') grants the right of residence to EU citizens who are family members of EU workers, even if they are not workers themselves (Article 7). Maria could potentially rely on this Directive if she has a family member who is an EU worker in Italy. Alternatively, Maria could potentially rely on the case law of the CJEU, which has recognized the right of residence for EU citizens who are not workers but can support themselves financially (Case C-138/02 Collins [2004] ECR I-2703, paragraph 61).","This question concerns one of the four basic freedoms of the single market- free movement of persons. The founding purpose of the EU was the creation of a common market in which barriers to trade between Member States were progressively removed. As free movement has significant implications for working people, this fundamental freedom was originally created to assist workers in accordance with Article 45 TFEU. Case law and secondary law expanded the scope of this right. In order to get full points for this question, both primary and secondary legal sources should be analysed. The most important is that you justified your answer with relevant sources and arguments. Below you can find a model answer, other sources than those named below could have also given points, if justified and explained correctly. According to Article 45 TFEU there is a right to free movement for workers within the EU. Since Maria is a Portuguese national, she falls within the personal scope of this article. Maria is currently working as a part time teacher and due to her part time employment; the Italian authorities stated that she could no longer be considered an 'EU worker'. In order to determine if this decision is legally correct, it is necessary to examine if part time employment could be included under the scope of Article 45 TFEU. The content and extent of the right to free movement of workers enshrined in the latter provision has been expanded through both the jurisprudence of the ECJ and secondary EU law. Under the guidelines provided by the ECJ, an individual has to comply with certain requirements in order to be considered an EU worker, such as, the performance of services for a certain period of time, being under the direction of another person and in exchange of a remuneration (see e.g. Lawrie- Blum v. Land Baden- Württemberg). In particular, the Court has expressly referred to part time work in the Levin case. According to ECJ in the latter decision: 'part-time employment is not excluded from the field of application of the rules on freedom of movement for workers as long as the person performs an effective and genuine activity, not on such a small scale as to be marginal or ancillary'(Levin v. Statssecretaris van Justitie). In the views of the Court, an effective and genuine activity covers full-time, part-time and occasional work as long as there is an employment relationship with regard to work that is 'not purely marginal or ancillary' (Kempf v. Staatscretaris van Justitie). Based on this, it would be possible to conclude that the decision emitted by the Italian authorities was not in accordance with EU law. In addition, Article 45 TFEU entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. The prohibition of discrimination has also been extended by the Workers Regulation (Art. 7.1) and by the ECJ through its case law (see e.g. John O'Flynn v. Adjudication Office). However, as an exception to this, according to Article 45(4) TFEU, States may reserve posts in the public service for their own nationals. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the ECJ has given a narrow interpretation to this provision. It follows from the jurisprudence of the regional tribunal that the position in question 'must be connected with the specific activities of the public service in so far as it is entrusted with the exercise of powers conferred by public law and with responsibility for safeguarding the general interest of the State' (Commission v. Belgium). In addition, as a national of an EU country (Portugal), Maria is an EU citizen. Citizens of the Union have the right to move freely within the territory of the European Union (Articles 20 and 21 TFEU). In line with Directive 2004/38 'on the rights of citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States', EU citizens can live in another EU Member State up to three months without any requirement other than holding a valid document. To stay more than three months, it is necessary to meet certain conditions depending on the person's status (worker, self-employed, etc.). Also, after legally residing for five years continuously in another Member State, EU citizens can have right of permanent residency.",,,,,

Presentation of the case: C-561/19, Consorzio Italian Management, Catania Multiservizi SpA v. Rete Ferroviaria","a) a summary of the relevant facts including who the parties are and what the dispute between them was about; The Parties are Consorzio Italian Management and Catania Multiservizi SpA as applicants, against Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA as respondent. The applicants had been granted a contract for the cleaning of railway stations etc, issued by Rete Ferroviaria Italian SpA. The applicants sought to review the compensation for the service, after increases to their costs, which the respondent refused. The applicants challenged that decision, to not review the costs, in national court. The applicants claimed that the national court should refer questions to the CJEU regarding whether EU law precludes the national provisions, and whether the Directive in question was valid or not. b) what procedures occurred in what courts and why; The national court asked questions to the CJEU through the preliminary ruling procedure under Article 267 TFEU. After having received the answers from the CJEU, the court asked again since there were new questions, and the court in question was subjected to Article 267(3) TFEU. c) description of the central legal issue(s) discussed by the Court of Justice Whether a court of last instance must ask questions to the CJEU again in the same case, after a previous referral, or whether national procedural law making new questions inadmissible, should be set aside. The questions posed by the national court also concerned whether EU law precludes the national law concerning the review of pricing. d) description of the relevant legal rules a.k.a. provisions of EU law Article 267 TFEU Principles of effectiveness and equivalence e) how the parties argued and the Court of Justice analysed and, CJEU: - The preliminary ruling procedure exist to ensure the uniformity of EU law [27] - The main rule of thumb is an obligation for courts with no judicial remedy under national law to refer questions regarding the interpretation of EU law [32] - There are exceptions however underlined in CILFIT, such as when EU law is irrelevant to the outcome of the case, there already exist relevant case-law from the CJEU, and that the correct interpretation is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt [33] - Yet for no reasonable doubt to exist, it must be equally obvious to the CJEU and other courts of last instance in the member states [40], remembering that EU law is multilingual and that only consulting one language version does not suffice, being particularly observant to differences put forward by the parties [42,43,44]. Also, the specificities of EU law, such as autonomous concepts must also be kept in mind [45,46]. - The procedure is completely independent from any initiative of the parties [53] - It is up to the national court to decide at what time to ask for a preliminary ruling, but before the case has been disposed of [56]. - Having already requested a preliminary ruling does not affect the obligation of asking regarding other questions [59]. - National courts of last instance do not have to refer when the questions are inadmissible under national procedural law, if those laws are in accordance with the principles of effectiveness and equivalence [61-63]. - There are issues with the order for reference and hence, questions two and three are declared inadmissible [70]. f) came to a conclusion regarding the issue(s) The fact that a court of last instance has already made a reference to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the same national proceedings does not remove the obligation to refer regarding new questions. The exceptions to that duty are stated in CILFIT and concerns irrelevancy, acte eclaire and act clair. Yet, a national court of last instance can also refrain from asking when the questions are inadmissible on grounds of national procedural law as long as that does not violate the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. 2. Consider, by writing an adequately organized legal analysis, the importance of this case in the general scheme of EU law. Reflect on what we have studied related to this case’s areas of substantive and procedural law, and other topics of your choice if time permits (7 p.). When discussing the judgment, make references to paragraph numbers, for example by adding “[5]” where appropriate. The Preliminary Ruling Procedure: Consorzio can be named CILFIT II - adjusting the exemptions provided for in CILFIT, when national courts adjudicating as last instance do not have to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (Art 267(3) TFEU). - Court of last instance have an obligation to refer. - The preliminary ruling procedure exists to ensure the uniform interpretation of EU law [27] - The courts of last instance may be exempted from referring following the CILFIT criterias, such as lack of relevance, acte eclaire and act clair. [33] - The main novelties with Conzortio focuses on adjusting the requirement of comparing language versions for act clair, reflecting the present-day conditions that there are 27 member states and not 10. It is clear to the CJEU that the old requirement of comparing all language versions was in fact not feasible from the start.
